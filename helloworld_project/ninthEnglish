Soil
<ol>
<li>Soil is your garden's natural growing medium, so it's vital for the health and successful growth of your plants and crops that you keep it well maintained. Soil is basically rock that's been ground down by the effects of the weather over a long period of time and made fertile by decayed organic matter (derived from dead insects and leaves). There are hundreds of different soil types, but they can broadly be classified as sandy, loamy or clay, referring to their basic texture. It is the texture that affects the drainage, aeration and nutrient content of the soil and you may have to take steps to improve on this in certain types of soil.</li>
<li>Take a handful of soil and run a small amount between your forefinger and thumb. Although all soils contain varying proportions of sand, silt and clay, you'll readily be able to tell the difference between the main types.</li>
<li>Sandy soil feels gritty when dry and even it's wet particles will not stick together. Loams, on the other hand, can be moulded in the hand when moist, but aren't at all sticky and gritty and are fairly loose when dry. Clay soil is sticky and smooth when wet, but becomes polished when rubbed and baked hard when dry.</li>
<li>A loamy soil is a well-balanced amalgamation of sand, silt and clay, which combines excellent drainage with sufficient moisture retention to assure good growing conditions for most plants. It's fairly easy to look after, although loamy soils do benefit from regular applications of well-rotted organic matter to prevent getting tightly packed.</li>
<li>The particle consistency of sandy soil doesn't hold water well, with the result that plant foods are often taken away by rain before they can do any good. Again, well-rotted organic matter can be added to bind the soil particles together.</li>
<li>Clay soil is most difficult to work, usually becoming waterlogged, so they are virtually impossible to dig. Artificial drainage will probably be the first step in improving the texture of the soil and various additives will break down the structure to make use of its excellent food stocks.</li>
<li>There are various methods of improving your soil's texture. Essentially this requires regular applications of a well-rotted organic substance called humus, which is obtained from decayed plant and animal matter (manure, compost, and seaweed, each provides ample sources).</li>
<li>The presence of chalk in soil can also affect the growth of plants: some prefer slightly acid (chalk-free) soils, while others grow more successfully in alkaline, chalky soils. Most fruits and vegetables, however, grow better in neutral soil.</li>
<li>Although benefiting the soil in some ways, compost, manure and fertilizers can actually add to its acidity, as organisms break them down. Over-acid soils can be treated with applications of lime-either hydrated (slaked) lime, or ground limestone (chalk). Of the two, ground limestone is your best choice.</li>
<li>To apply lime, sprinkle it on the broken top soil and mix it lightly but don't dig in; leave to wash down by rain. Apply lime every other year if need be.<br />
An alkaline soil can be treated with manure, garden compost or peat, well dug in.</li>

Attitude Problems
<ol>
<li>Fear of failure is an attitude problem. All of us postpone things. We procrastinate. We rationalize. We make excuses. We foolishly believe that to be creative and to have a positive attitude and to simply do things, we have to have all kinds of preconditions.</li>
<li>You can find several excuses for waiting to be more creative. But scratch the surface of these smooth and logical rationalizations, and if you're honest, you'll see the face of a little demon, the fear of failure, hiding there.</li>
<li>Zig Ziglar reminds us that this is nothing but an attitude problem: "The future can be depressing or magnificent-it is not correlated to the present or the past, past failures or successes. It is only our attitude towards these failures or successes which determines our future." You can change yourself by changing your attitude without fear of error.</li>
<li>Problems cause stress and stress reduces our effectiveness. So it is very logical that once we solve our problems, we should be able to increase our efficiency and effectiveness. Incidentally, we can't eliminate problems unless we opt for the final exit-the very thought of this itself is stressful!</li>
<li>What causes our problems? Well, roughly speaking one third of our problems are there because we are alive and kicking; another one-third of our problems are created by ourselves; and the remaining one-third of our problems exist because of greed and ego.</li>
<li>When too many problems are causing you enormous stress and strain, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Think&#8230;there must be a better way to solve these problems. It helps to remember the crow and jug story! Recall similar stories and incidents.</li>
<li>Ask, ask, ask&#8230;from yourself and from others, how to do things in better ways. May be certain things should not be done at all or should be clubbed with other activities! Don't forget that even stupid questions will get your intelligent and common sense answers.</li>
<li>Do it now! Start doing it. Don't forget that the first step towards solving a problem is to begin. The first step is the most difficult one, but taking it will kill procrastination- a disease or a problem in itself.&#8217; Do, not forget to priorities your problems first. Those which are "C" category jobs should be delegated to others, but do not forget to check and recheck till these get done.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There is always a silver lining in any gloomy situation, provided you starve the problems<br />
and feed the opportunities. For every problem, there could be several solutions, and solutions point towards opportunities.</li>
<li>Apply the MISER concept to solve problems. MISER&#8230; where M stands for Merge, I for Improve, S for Simplify, E for Eliminate and R for Reduce. MISER is an excellent conceptual sieve that helps in reducing many problems to a very few ones.</li>

The Way Human Body Defends
<ol>
<li>The defence mechanism of human body is a gift of nature provided to human beings. The power of our body to fight against various disease-producing agents is known as defensive mechanism. This defensive mechanism depends upon various factors which can be categorised mainly into two types-common factors and special factors.</li>
<li>Amongst the common factors, the most important is the health of human beings. We all know if we are having a good health, our body automatically remains protected against the diseases. For keeping good health one should have nutritious balanced diet. A balanced diet is that which contains carbohydrates, fat, proteins, vitamins in proportionate amount.</li>
<li>The skin of our body saves us against many micro-organisms producing diseases, provided that it is intact. In case there are cuts or abrasions on it, the micro-organisms penetrate the body through those cuts and abrasions and can cause diseases. Therefore, a cut or an abrasion should never be left open. In case there is no bandage, etc. available, it may be covered by a clean cloth.</li>
<li>Some bacteria are residing on and inside the human body. They are our friends and are useful for us. They do not cause any disease and by their presence they do not allow disease-causing organisms to settle on those places. For example, the micro-organisms, present in human saliva secrete a chemical which does not allow diphtheria causing bacteria to grow inside the oral cavity.</li>
<li>The human body secretes a variety of fluids, which are killers for disease causing micro¬organisms. For example, gastric juice (acidic in nature) secreted by our intestinal tract kills all organisms which enter our body through food.</li>
<li>There are a few automatic activities of our body known as "reflex phenomenon" which<br />
protect the body against many infections. This reflex phenomenon includes sneezing, coughing and vomiting. •</li>
<li>Fever is one of the most important constituents of the defensive mechanism of our body. The organ which regulates the temperature of our body is known as hypothalamus and it is situated in the brain. When micro-organisms after entering the body release toxic products and these reach the brain through blood, the hypothalamus starts increasing the temperature of body the person gets fever. This fever is very useful for the human body because by the increase of temperature the micro-organisms which are the root cause of the problem get killed.</li>
<li>We are living in an environment which is full of bacteria. Many of these bacteria can produce serious diseases, but all of us do not suffer from such diseases. It is due to a special power present in our body to fight these diseases. A part of this special power of our body is known as innate immunity. This is inherited by us. The other part of this special power is called acquired immunity. This we gain during our lifetime.</li>
<li>In a nutshell, we can say since nature has provided us with defensive mechanism to fight against so many diseases, let us maintain it and rather increase it by the way of immunisation.</li>

Save The Caves
<ol>
<li>One thousand and five hundred years ago, when craftsmen began cutting rocks and sculpting them into magnificent statues of gods, little did they realise that in the second millennium the Elephanta Caves would not just be a major tourist attraction but would also be a World Heritage Site.</li>
<li>Now the world's oldest island caves are getting a new lease of life. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has teamed up with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to spruce up the caves and protect them from further decay and degeneration.</li>
<li>Elephanta Caves date back to the sixth century and boast of some of India's most magnificent rock-cut sculptures of Lord Shiva. Situated about 11 km from the Gateway of India, these caves are reached by small boats. Once on the island, visitors have to climb over 1,000 stone steps to get to the caves.</li>
<li>The caves were originally built during the reign of the Rashtraputa kings. They contain huge images of Brahma, Parvati, Natraja and Shiva. The best and most famous of these is Maheshmurti-a three headed bust of Shiva which is about six metres high.</li>
<li>The great elephant structure in black stone which gave the island its name was removed in 1864 by British to take it to England. However, it was later returned to India and now stands at the Victoria Gardens, a park with a small zoo in the centre of Mumbai. On top of the caves are two huge cannons installed by the British in order to protect Bombay harbour.</li>
<li>In the main cave there are nine carvings which depict the life of Lord Shiva in different manifestations--the dancer (Nataraja), Shiva killing demon Andhaka, marriage ceremony of Shiva and Parvati, Shiva's descent to the Ganges, Shiva as Ardhnarinateshwar, Shiva as Maheshmurti, Shiva lifting Mount Kailash, Goddess Parvati on Mount Kailash and Shiva as ascetic.</li>
<li>Back in the mid-eighties, a team of leading international archaeologists, conservators and historians visited the site and forwarded a proposal to UNESCO to grant heritage status to the caves. The proposal was accepted and Elephanta Caves were declared a World Heritage Site in 1987.</li>
<li>The most important part of the effort is to clean up the surroundings of the heritage site.<br />
For example, there is an ancient site built adjacent to the gate which houses some of the best frescoes and showcases the art of carving out statues by cutting rock. &#8216;</li>
<li>The next phase was to clean up the littered surroundings and also to discourage yisitors from carrying eatables and plastic bags inside the caves. This step too was roundly criticised but gradually people were educated on the historic and religious importance of the caves and the incidents of littering have considerably reduced.</li>
<li>To protect the caves from vandalism security personnel were deployed a year ago. "This has helped authorities to implement regulations stringently," says an INTACH volunteer of the organisation's Mumbai chapter.</li>
<li>Elephanta Caves have for years been threatened by the rapid industrial development in<br />
their vicinity. A toxic chemical storage terminal has been planned just 400 metres away. Bilge from oil-exploring activities and plastic dumped in the sea, have seriously threatened marine and bird life of the area.</li>

Self-Esteem
<ol>
<li>Today, when we pick up a daily newspaper, we invariably find an increasing incidence of vandalism, fraud, theft, robbery, rape, child abuse, battered spouses, murders, hate crimes, genocide (now termed as "ethnic cleansing") along with a multitude of other senseless violent acts that have become disturbingly common. These are not the actions of people who like themselves.</li>
<li>The solution to a great many problems, whether personal, national or global, lies in improving our feelings about ourselves both as individuals and members of society. When the significance of good self-esfeem is well understood and it achieves the prominence it deserves, a transformation will begin, for as the people will learn they are deserving of self-respect, their respect for others will automatically increase.</li>
<li>Most of our behaviour has been shaped by our parents, caregivers and authority figures who played an important part in our early upbringing and were responsible for crystallizing our ideas about ourselves and the world. While everyone has self-esteem, only a small percentage of us have high self-esteem. High self-esteem denotes that we accept ourselves unconditionally exactly as we are, we appreciate our value as a human being. When, on the other hand, we have low self-esteem, we believe that we have little intrinsic worth.</li>
<li>We believe our personal value is in direct proportion to the value of our accomplishments. If we cannot accomplish certain results, we tend to feel low about ourselves. Some of us try too hard and become workaholics and over-achievers. With few genuine feelings of self-worth, we try to create some and prove that we are somebody by our successes and achievements. Because our desire for perfection is so great, we tend to set unrealistic goals and place unreasonable demands on ourselves. Failing, rather than encouraging us to have more realistic aspirations, only leads to a mere punishing round of self-blame and a resolve to drive ourselves harder next time. If we do finally achieve our goals we are disappointed; despite everything we have done, we still feel empty inside.</li>
<li>Vulnerable to the opinions of others, we desperately try to gain their recognition and approval sometimes through risky and dangerous behaviour. Thus we are at the mercy of our emotions, instead of controlling them, we permit them to control us. Since we allow circumstances to influence our feelings, we are inclined to be moody. The insecurity we feel as a result of devaluing ourselves makes us react with jealousy, envy and possessiveness. Fear makes us greedy and acquisitive, and feelings of self-hate alternate with those of futility, unhappiness and depression.</li>
<li>Sound self-esteem is the basis for all self improvement. As human beings, our potential<br />
is limitless, our abilities inexhaustible, and the possibilities for creative and constructive changes are endless. But, we won't experience satisfactory progress towards our goals or make any lasting improvements unless we believe we deserve the good we want. Conditions in our lives will improve permanently only when we believe we are entitled to something better. So improving our self-esteem inwardly is the vital ingredient for improving our lives.</li>

Disposal Of Nuclear Wastes
<ol>
<li>Just a century ago it would have been hard to imagine that human beings could significantly pollute the oceans. Human beings constitute the greatest threat to the oceans since the development of the nuclear industry. Nuclear power has become a major source of the world's electric energy. But nuclear power plants also produce a great amount of nuclear waste which remains hazardous for thousands of years.</li>
<li>For the purpose of disposal, nuclear wastes are of two categories: Low Level Waste (LLW), which includes several substances used in connection with nuclear reactors and High Level Waste (HLW) which consists primarily of spent fuel from nuclear reactors and weapons. Currently, there is no permanent method of disposal for HLW. All the HLW that has been produced so far is being stored near the reactor sites in swimming pools or in dry casks. These storage pools are not designed to store the waste for an indefinite period of time. As higli level nuclear waste presents a tremendous storage problem, dumping it into the ocean was considered as the most cost-effective solution.</li>
<li>Even though dumping of highly radioactive wastes at sea was banned worldwide for more than three decades, it still continues. Russia has been dumping highly radioactive materials in the Arctic Sea. Until the London Dumping Convention in 1983, the Atlantic Ocean was a favourite dumping ground for nuclear nations like Great Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Switzerland and Sweden.</li>
<li>The dumping of nuclear wastes not only goes against international practice, but is also a violation of international treaties. Dumping of the wastes is regulated by the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (the 1972 London Convention). The Convention outlawed the disposal of high-level wastes at sea. It required the nations disposing of low-level radioactive wastes to do so in ocean basins at depths greater than 12,000 feet. But the depths at which the actual dumping took place was within the range of 200 to 1,000 feet, which is a clear violation of the convention.</li>
<li>Although the dumping of any radioactive waste at sea has been prohibited by law since 1994, the status of sub-seabed disposal has been ambiguous. If a resolution is made to extend the definition of "dumping" to include "any deliberate disposal or storage of wastes or other matter in the sea-bed and the subsoil thereof" and accepted by the convention, sub-seabed disposal will be prohibited, and the decision may not be appealed for twenty five years. If it is so, then sub-seabed disposal will be subjected to regulation and subsequent banning by the London Dumping Convention. Article III, section 1(a) of the convention defines dumping as "any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea."</li>
<li>On the contrary, United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), reveals that the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil is beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. The seabed area is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any nation and is open to use by all in accordance with commonly acceptable rules. Even though UNCLOS may not directly prohibit sub-seabed disposal, there are other provisions such as "to protect and preserve the marine environment" which will put a legal binding on the member states while undertaking the disposal.</li>

Urban Flooding
<ol>
<li>The National Disaster Management Authority has recently released guidelines on the management of urban flooding. It clearly states that urban flooding should be treated as a separate disaster as the causes of urban flooding and the strategies to deal with them are different.</li>
<li>Even though urban flooding has been experienced for decades in India sufficient attention was not given to plan specific efforts to deal with it holistically. In the past, any strategy on Flood Disaster Management largely focused on riverine floods affecting large tracts of rural areas.</li>
<li>Urban Flooding is significantly different from rural flooding as urbanisation leads to developed catchments which increases the flood peaks by up to 8 times and flood volumes up to 6 times. Consequently flooding occurs very quickly due to faster flow times, sometimes in matter of minutes.</li>
<li>Urban areas are centres of economic activities with vital infrastructure which needs to be protected 24 x 7. In most of the cities, damage to vital infrastructure has a bearing not only locally but could even have global implications.</li>
<li>Urban areas are also densely populated and people living in vulnerable areas, both rich and poor, suffer due to flooding. It has sometimes resulted in loss of life, damage to property and disruptions in transport and power bringing life to a grinding halt causing untold misery and hardships. Even the secondary effects of subsequent epidemics and exposure to infection often takes further toll in terms of loss of livelihood, human suffering, and, in extreme cases, loss of life. Therefore, management of urban flooding has to be accorded top priority.</li>
<li>There has been an increasing trend of urban flood disasters in India over the past several years. Almost every major city in India has been severely affected. Mumbai floods of July<br />
2005 turned out to be an eye opener. The deluge of rains in the catchment areas of the Yamuna during August and September in 2010 has inundated many villages and towns of Haryana, besides threatening .the low-lying areas of the Delhi, the national capital. The fury of floods did not spare many areas of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.</li>
<li>Storm Water Drainage systems in the past were designed for a rainfall intensity of 12-20 mm/h. However, we have been experiencing rainfall of higher intensities in most of our cities every year, which overwhelm the SWD system. Moreover, the systems very often do not work to the designed capacities because of encroachments, dumping of solid waste and poor operations and maintenance.</li>
<li>Improper disposal of solid waste, including domestic, commercial and industrial waste and dumping of construction debris into the drains also contributes significantly to reducing their capacities. Every body is responsible for this.</li>
<li>Encroachments are a major problem in many cities and towns all over the country. With large scale encroachments on the natural drains and in the floodplains, the capacity of the natural drain has decreased, resulting in flooding even with lower intensities of rainfall.</li>

Gandhi&#8217;s Views
<ol>
<li>Gandhi never urged anyone to renounce wealth or power. He taught a set of values that might make happiness less dependant on material possessions. "As long as you desire inner help and comfort from anything, you should keep it," he suggested tolerantly. Otherwise, he said, you might renounce a worldly asset 'in a mood of self-sacrifice or out of a stern sense of duty' but want it back and suffer.</li>
<li>"I wholeheartedly detest," Gandhi declared, "this mad desire to destroy distance and time, to increase animal appetites, and to go to the ends of the earth in search of their satisfaction. None of this is taking the world a step nearer its goal."</li>
<li>Gandhi is known for his successful efforts to liberate India. Actually, for him the development of the Indian into a free man was more important than the freeing of India. Most of Gandhi's followers in India were not Gandhians and did not share his ideals; they mere accepted his leadership because it smoothed the way to their objective which was an Indian nation without the British but with all the usual attributes of nationhood. For them, national independence was an end, a goal in itself: for him it was a means to a better man and better life, and because his heart was heavy with doubts whether these purposes would be furthered by the manner in which independence was achieved-two bleeding children torn violently from the body of mother India-he did not celebrate on August 15, 1947, the day the Indian nation came into his own world-he was sad and refused congratulations.</li>
<li>Gandhi was a nationalist, he loved India, but he was no Indo-maniac. He said he would not hurt England to help India. All the years he fought British-Boer racial discrimination in South Africa and British imperialism in India he never despised or revised 'the enemy'. He wanted to understand them. The British in India were victims of their past. In liberating India Gandhi thought he was also freeing England for a new future.</li>
<li>For mental health, Gandhi prescribed truth. He brought for himself a unity of what he believed, what he did and what he said. Creed, deed and word for one. This is the integration which is integrity or truth. When utterances conflict with actions and actions with beliefs the individual is split, and sick. Gandhi preached what he practised and practised what he believed. I found him healthy, happy, and light-hearted despite his many sorrows and burdens. He enjoyed inner harmony.</li>
<li>'Perhaps', the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote of Gandhi, 'he will not succeed.<br />
Perhaps he will fail as the Buddha failed and as Christ failed to wean men from their iniquities, but he will always be remembered as one who made his life a lesson for all ages to come.'</li>

An Educator&#8217;s Triple Weapons
<ol>
<li>In my boyhood, the teacher never appeared in public without the cane in hand. I used to think that one's guru was born clutching a cane in his right hand while the left held a pinch of snuff between the thumb and forefinger. He took a deep inhalation before proceeding to flick the cane on whatever portion of myself was available for the purpose. I really had no idea what I was expected to do or not do to avoid it. I could never imagine that a simple error of calculation in addition, subtraction or multiplication (I never knew which) would drive anyone hysterical.</li>
<li>I notice nowadays a little girl at home always playing the school game in a comer of the verandah, but never without a flat wooden foot-rule in hand, which she flourishes menacingly at the pupils assembled in her phantasmagoric class-room. On investigation, I found that the cane, being discredited, has yielded place to the foot-rule, especially in 'convent' schools. The foot-rule has the advantage over the primitive birch of mauling without marking (which could count as an achievement in torturing technique) and it also possesses the innocent appearance of a non-violent, pedagogic equipment. A modem educator, naturally has to adapt his ways to modem circumstances, and put away obsolete weapons. The flat-scale is employed only at the primary stage: at higher levels of education, torments to a young soul are devised in subtler forms progressively; admissions, textbooks, and examination are the triple weapons in the hands of an educator today.</li>
<li>In June every father and son go through a purgatory of waiting at the doors of every college. Provision of seats planned in a grand musical-chair-manner keeps every applicant running frantically about, unless, as in certain well-geared technical colleges, the parent could make a bid in the style of a competitor at a toddy auction. Fifty thousand rupees for<br />
an engineering seat is considered quite reasonable nowadays. I recently met a hopeful father who had just written a cheque for ninety thousand rupees for two sons in the first year B.E. in a certain college. He is a businessman fully aware of the debit and credit value of his action, and must have undertaken the financial sacrifice after due consideration. Those that cannot afford it have to queue up in the corridors of colleges, hunt and gather recommendations, plead, appeal, canvass, and lose weight until they find (or do not find) their names in the list of admissions. At the next stage the student will once again queue up, beg, beat about, and appeal-for textbooks this time (especially if it happens to be a 'Nationalized Textbook', which may not be available until the young man is ready to leave the college.)</li>
<li>Finally the examination-in a civilized world the examination system should have no place. It is a culmination of all sadistic impulses. The real wrecker of young nerves, however, is the examination system. It builds up a tension and an anxiety neurosis day by day all the year round, all through one's youth, right into middle age (for some).</li>

My Dog Marcus
<ol>
<li>Anyone who has met Marcus, my huge, handsome lazy, stupid St. Bernard, will not believe that he recently had an idea. This idea was certainly the first he has ever had and I cannot think how he recognized it.</li>
<li>The idea had something to do with making life easy for St. Bernard.</li>
<li>Roughly, then, his idea was this: "If I were deaf, I couldn't hear when they called me for my walk, and they wouldn't be able to move me, because nothing can move me. So I will pretend to be deaf."</li>
<li>The day on which he put his plan into action, my wife, came to me much disturbed. 'Poor old Marcus has gone deaf!' she exclaimed.</li>
<li>'Deaf?' I cried. 'But he could hear perfectly well last night.' I went into the kitchen and addressed him. 'Coming for a walk, Marcus?' I said.</li>
<li>Marcus, like a perfect actor, gazed at me with eager devotion, as though he would have given his last bone to have heard what I said. After a good deal of shouting, we left him where he was, and he went to sleep smiling.</li>
<li>It was some days before we noticed that Marcus was only partly deaf, he was still able to hear anything connected with food. I was carving a joint one Sunday when a tiny scrap of meat slipped from the fork and dropped on the carpet. Although Marcus was asleep in the kitchen-some distance away-he heard it fall. He hurtled into the dining-room and gulped it down. 'Hey!' I said, 'I thought you were deaf!'</li>
<li>Marcus's jaw and tail both dropped. He seemed to remember that he was deaf.</li>
<li>Not much later he failed to hear three repeated commands to come out for a walk-then leapt to his feet at the arrival of the butcher. In the end my wife and I agreed that he had to be cured.</li>
<li>The course we took was not, perhaps, entirely sporting. Marcus had gone deaf; we would go silent. When Marcus was about, we would now go through the actions of speaking but would not say a word.</li>
<li>Marcus's first reaction was to be lazily puzzled. Very soon he was really worried. Had he over-estimated his power and gone really deaf? The horrible part was that, for all he knew, we might be talking about food. The thought of what he might be missing was real torture to him.</li>
<li>As we mouthed silently at one another, Marcus would stare painfully into our faces, trying, I swear, to lip-read- Also, as he was never called now for meals, I doubt if he had fourteen hours' real sleep out of the twenty-four, and he worried himself down to about three hundred pounds in weight.</li>
<li>We kept this up for several days. Then we decided to restore Marcus's hearing. I said in a loud voice one morning, 'Come on, Marcus! Time for your walk, boy.'</li>
<li>An expression of beautiful relief spread over his vast face. He was not dear at all! He bounded to his feet. He frisked to the gate like a lively pony. He joyously took one of the longest walks of his career-almost half a mile.</li>
<li>Marcus was not troubled again with his deafness. Neither were we.</li>

<li>To the little girl he was a figure to be feared and avoided. Every morning before going to work he came into her room and gave her a casual kiss to which she responded with "Goodbye, Father." And oh, there was a glad sense of relief when she heard the noise of carriage growing fainter and fainter down the long road!</li>
<li>"Well, Kezia, have you been a good girl today?"<br />
"I d-d-don't know, Father."<br />
"You d-d-don't know? If you stutter like that Mother will have to take you to the doctor?"</li>
<li>She never strutted with other people-had quite given it up-but only with Father, because then she was trying so hard to say the words properly. "What's the matter? What are you looking so wretched about? Mother, I wish you taught this child not to appear on the brink of suicide&#8230;Here, Kezia, carry my teacup back to the table carefully."<br />
He was so big-his hands and his neck, especially his mouth when he yawned. Thinking about him alone was like thinking about a giant.</li>
<li>On Sunday afternoons grandmother sent her down to the drawing-room to have a "nice talk with father and mother". But the little girl always found mother reading and father stretched out on the sofa, his handkerchief on his face, his feet on one of the best cushions, sleeping soundly and snoring.<br />
She sat on a stool, gravely watched him until he woke and stretched, and asked the time-then looked at her. "Don't stare so, Kezia. You look like a little brown owl."<br />
One day, when she was kept indoors with a cold, the grandmother told her that father's birthday was next week, and suggested she should make him a pin-cushion for a gift out of a beautiful piece of yellow silk.</li>
<li>Labouriously with a double cotton, the little girl stitched three sides. But what to fill it with? That was the question. The grandmother was out in the garden and she wandered into mother's bedroom to look for 'scraps'. On the bedtable she discovered a great many sheets of fine paper, gathered them up, tore them into tiny pieces, and stuffed her ease, then served up the fourth side.<br />
That night there was hue and cry in the house. Father's great speech for the Port Authority had been lost. Rooms were searched-servants questioned.<br />
Finally mother came into Kezia's room.<br />
"Oh! Yes," she said, "I tore them up for my surprise."<br />
"What!" screamed mother. "Come straight down to the dining-room this instant."</li>
<li>And she was dragged down to where father was pacing to and fro, hands behind his back. "Well?" he said sharply.<br />
Mother explained.<br />
He stopped and stared at the child.<br />
"Did you do that?"</li>

Aunt Jennifer&#8217;s Tigers
Aunt Jennifer's tigers prance across a screen,<br />
Bright denizens of a world of green.<br />
They do not fear the men beneath the tree;<br />
They pace in sleek chivalric certainty.<br />
Aunt Jennifer's fingers fluttering through her wool<br />
Find even the ivory needle hard to pull.<br />
The massive weight of uncle's wedding band<br />
Sits heavily upon Aunt Jennifer's hand.<br />
When Aunt is dead, her terrified hands will lie<br />
Still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by.<br />

doze, open mouthed, her face ashen like that<br />
of a corpse and realised with pain<br />
that she thought away, and looked but soon<br />
put that thought away, and looked out at young<br />
trees sprinting, the merry children spilling<br />
out of their homes, but after the airport's<br />

Two Tramps in Mud Time
Out of the mud two strangers came<br />
And caught me splitting wood in the yard.<br />
And one of them put me off my aim<br />
<strong>4</strong> By hailing cheerily 'Hit them hard!'<br />
I knew pretty well why he dropped behind<br />
And let the other go on a way.<br />
I knew pretty well what he had in mind:<br />
<strong>8</strong> He wanted to take my job for pay.<br />
Good blocks of beech it was I split<br />
As large around as the chopping block;<br />
And every piece I squarely hit<br />
<strong>12</strong> Fell splinterless as a cloven rock.<br />
The blows that a life of self-control<br />
Spares to strike for the common good<br />
That day, giving a loose to my soul,<br />
<strong>16</strong> I spent on the unimportant wood.<br />
The sun was warm but the wind was chill,<br />
You know how it is with on April day<br />
When the sun is out and the wind is still,<br />
<strong>20</strong> You're one month on in the middle of May.<br />
But if you so much as dare to speak,<br />
A cloud comes over the sunlit arch,<br />
A wind comes off a frozen peak,<br />
<strong>24</strong> And you're two months back in the middle of March.<br />
A bluebird comes tenderly up to alight<br />
And fronts the wind to unruffle a plume,<br />
His song so pitched as not to excite<br />
<strong>28</strong> A single flower as yet to bloom.<br />
It is snowing a flake; and he half knew<br />
Winter was only playing possum,<br />
Except in colour he isn't blue,<br />
<strong>32</strong> But he wouldn't advise a thing to blossom.<br />
The water for which we may have to look<br />
In summer time with a witching-wand,<br />
In every wheelrut's now a brook,<br />
<strong>36</strong> In every print of a hoof a pond.<br />
Be glad of water, but don't forget<br />
The lurking frost in the earth beneath<br />
That will steal forth after the sun is set<br />
<strong>40</strong> And show on the water its crystal teeth.<br />
The time when most I loved my task<br />
These two must make me love it more<br />
By coming with what they came to ask.<br />
<strong>44</strong> You'd think I never had felt before<br />
The weight of an axe-head poised aloft,<br />
The grip on earth of outspread feet,<br />
The life of muscles rocking soft<br />
<strong>48</strong> and smooth and moist in vernal heat.<br />
Out of the woods two hulking tramps<br />
(From sleeping God knows where last night,<br />
But not long since in the lumber camps).<br />
<strong>52</strong> They thought all chopping was theirs of right.<br />
Men of the woods and lumber jacks<br />
They judged me by their appropriate tool,<br />
Except as a fellow handled an axe.<br />
<strong>56</strong> They had no way of knowing a fool.<br />
Nothing on either side was said,<br />
They knew they had but to stay their stay<br />
And all their logic would fill my head;<br />
<strong>60</strong> As that I had no right to play<br />
With what was another man's work for gain,<br />
My right might be love but theirs was need.<br />
And where the two exist in twain<br />
<strong>64</strong> Theirs was the better right-agreed<br />
But yield who will to their separation,<br />
My object in living is to unite<br />
My avocation and my vocation<br />
<strong>68</strong> As my two eyes make one in sight.<br />
Only where love and need are one,<br />
And the work is play for mortal stakes,<br />
Is the deed ever really done<br />
<strong>72</strong> For heaven and the future's stakes.</p>

Elegy on the death of a mad dog
Good people all, of every sort,<br />

In Islington there was a man,<br />
Of whom the world might say,<br />

A kind and gentle heart he had,<br />
To comfort friends and foes;<br />

But mongrel, puppy, whelp, and hound,<br />
<strong>16</strong> And curs of low degree.<br />
This dog and man at first were friends;<br />
But when a pique began,<br />
The dog, to gain some private ends,<br />
<strong>20</strong> Went mad and bit the man.<br />
Around from all the neighbouring streets<br />
The wond'ring neighbours ran,<br />
And swore the dog had lost his wits,<br />
<strong>24</strong> To bite so good a man.<br />
The wound it seem'd both sore and sad<br />
To every Christian eye:<br />
And while they swore the dog was mad,<br />
<strong>28</strong> The swore the man would die.<br />

The death of sohrab
He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took<br />
The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased<br />
His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood<br />
Came welling from the open gash, and life<br />
<strong>5</strong> Flowed with the stream; all down his cold white side<br />
The crimson torrent ran, dim now, and soiled,<br />
Like the soiled tissue of white violets<br />
Left, freshly gathered, on their native bank<br />
By romping children, whom their nurses call<br />
<strong>10</strong> From the hot fields at noon; his head drooped low,<br />
His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay-<br />
White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,<br />
Deep, heavy gasps, quivering through all his frame,<br />
Convulsed him back to life, he opened them,<br />
<strong>15</strong> And fixed them feebly on his father's face:<br />
Till now all strength was ebbed, and from his limbs<br />
Unwillingly the spirit fled away,<br />
Regretting the warm mansion which it left,<br />
And youth arid bloom, and this delightful world.<br />
<strong>20</strong> So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead,<br />
And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak<br />
Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son,<br />
As those black granite pillars, once high-reared<br />
By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear<br />
<strong>25</strong> His house, now, mid their broken flights of steps,<br />
Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side-<br />
So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.<br />
And night came down over the solemn waste,<br />
And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,<br />
<strong>30</strong> And darkened all; and a cold fog, with night,<br />
Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,<br />
As of a great assembly loosed, and fires<br />
Began to twinkle through the fog; for now<br />
Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal:<br />
<strong>35</strong> The Persians took it on the open sands<br />
Southward; the Tartars by the river marge;<br />
And Rustum and his son were left alone.</p>

Ah! soon, when winter has all our vales opprest,<br />

Wilt thou glide on the blue Pacific, or rest<br />

Already arrived am inhaling the odorous air:<br />
I watch thee enter unerringly where thou goest,<br />
<strong>12</strong> And anchor queen of the strange shipping there,<br />
Thy sails for awnings spread, thy masts bare;<br />
Nor is aught from foaming reef to the snow-capped, grandest<br />
Peak, that is over the feathery palms more fair<br />
<strong>16</strong> Than thou, so upright, so stately, and still thou standest.<br />
And yet, O splendid ship, unhailed and nameless,<br />
I know not if, aiming a fancy, I rightly divine<br />
That thou hast a purpose joyful, a courage blameless,<br />
<strong>20</strong> Thy port assured in a happier land than mine.<br />
But for all I have given thee, beauty enough is thine,<br />
As thou, aslant with trim tackle and shrouding,<br />
From the proud nostril curve of a prow's line<br />
<strong>24</strong> In the offing scatterest foam, thy white sails crowding.<br />

They are strewn like blossoms mown down by chance<br />

Or compass the woe of the watch I keep?<br />
Or the pride that thrills thro' my heart's despair<br />
And the hope that comforts the anguish of prayer?<br />
And the far and glorious vision I see<br />

When the terror and tumult of hate shall cease<br />
And life be refashioned on anvils of peace,<br />

<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Passage 1:  </strong></span><br />
qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
The art of reading right
<ol>
<li>Reading Comprehension (RC, as it is normally called) is the most peculiar section in almost all scholastic, entrance and employment tests. The skills in RC make a lot of difference to one's chances of good grades/selection.</li>
<li>Most students find it difficult to tackle topics that are diverse from the field they are in or they are comfortable with. So one needs to develop a taste for even the most obscure and boring topic on this planet. For success in RC one should be able to understand. And even with an average speed one can succeed if one implements the strategies.</li>
<li>Broadly speaking, RC passages can be classified in a few categories. Fact based RC is the simplest form of RC. These types of passages have lot of information in the form of names, numbers etc. In this type of passages one should read very fast.</li>
<li>Don't try to memorize any facts, numbers or names etc. In fact there is no need to even remember them. Just make yourself familiar with the structure of the passage. Just see in which paragraph author is talking about what. Mark it. Then when you go to the questions, identify in which paragraph information regarding that question is mentioned. Go to that paragraph, read the numbers, names etc. and mark the answer.</li>
<li>Inference based RC is the toughest form of RC. Here the passage is fairly tough to understand. This includes passages on topics like Religion, Spirituality, Philosophy, etc. Most of the students will be comfortable attempting these passages at least in RC. The reading speed is fairly slow in this type of passages. The way to master this type of passages is to read them again and again while practising.</li>
<li>Topic based RC includes passages on any particular topic like economics, astrology, medical science, etc. Generally what makes -these passages tough is usage of technical terms. If a topic is new to us then presence of technical term scares us even if they are defined in the passage. For success in this type of passages we need to have a fan-understanding of the definition of the term if it is defined in the passage. Read that definition twice if you need to. But don't worry about technical terms if they are not defined in the passage. Assume them to be non-existent and proceed. Key principle in these passages is that don't go to the next line unless the previous line is clear.</li>
<li>Reading passage first and then questions is the most popular strategy for RC. While answering the question you may come back to the passage to find answer as you have just read the passage initially and not crammed it. But you should not come back for each and every question. If you come back for majority of questions then you haven't read the passage properly. The key to success for this strategy is that you should understand the passage very well. We will suggest students to follow this technique from the beginning and work upon this.</li>
<li>Reading questions first and then passage is the strategy followed by a few students. They just look at the questions and not options. The objective is that after seeing the questions when you read the passage then you read only that part carefully where the answer is given. The flaw with this is that you will not be able to remember all the questions. Besides this, this strategy fails when there are questions that require understanding of the passage.</li>
</ol>
pqro
xproAnswer the following questions by choosing the most appropriate option:   
<ol type="a">
<li>Most students find Reading Comprehension difficult because
<li>the language is tough</li>
<li>the vocabulary is difficult</li>
<li>the style is too involved</li>
<li>the topics are unrelated to their interest</li>
</li>
<li>Fact based RC is the easiest because
<li>it is written in simple language</li>
<li>there are no allusions</li>
<li>it contains information</li>
<li>it can be memorised easily</li>
</li>
<li>For answering a question on RC, one should
<li>memorise the facts, figures, etc.</li>
<li>mark what the author is talking about in the para</li>
<li>mark the essential details of the passage</li>
<li>remember the names, numbers, etc.</li>
</li>
<li>Topic based RC is tough as
<li>it contains technical terms</li>
<li>it is based on different topics</li>
<li>it demands instant understanding</li>
<li>one can't read them fast enough</li>
</li>
<li>Careful reading of the passage is essential for
<li>answering difficult questions</li>
<li>saving time and effort</li>
<li>proper understanding and answering correctly</li>
<li>selective identification of relevant parts</li>
</li>
<li>The word 'diverse' in para 2 means
<li>similar</li>
<li>same</li>
<li>variety</li>
<li>different</li>
</li>
</ol>
xproAnswer the following questions in brief:   
<strong>7.</strong> What should one do for finding the right answers?<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Why is topic based R C tough?<br />
<strong>9.</strong> Which step is considered more essential for finding right answers? Why?<br />
<strong>10.</strong> What is the most popular strategy for solving Reading Comprehension(RC)?<br />
<strong>11.</strong> Find the words similar in the meaning from passage.<br />
<li>Different (para 2)</li>
<li>Accept as true (para 6)</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
Playing the mind game
<ol>
<li>The Mastermind quiz is billed as a "battle of minds'. This battle is fought in two halves. In the first, each of four participants faces a barrage of questions, for two minutes, on any topic of his or her choice. In the second round, the questions are on general knowledge. There are two points for each correct answer and zero for wrong answers and passes. In the event of a tie, the person who has passed fewer questions wins.</li>
<li>Questions can be bizarre, but they are answered none the less. "It absolutely amazes you that these guys know so much. In KBC, it used to be, that this guy knows so little," says Basu after the show. Siddhartha Basu was the director of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC).</li>
<li>This year's Mastermind final was won by Ramanand Janardhana, a 22 year-old software engineer from Pune. Janardhana had Agatha Christie's 'Tommy and Tupence' novels as his specialist topic. He even knew that Tommy used asofoetida to create a stink in his room.</li>
<li>There are, of course, all sorts of quizzers. The diary-toting, Manorama yearbook, wielding variety will typically prepare for a contest by 'studying'. He knows that the best questions, the ones that get the 'wah-wahs', are always repeated. He is a solid quizzer, because he knows the obvious.</li>
<li>There is the other kind, like Janardhana, who claim they do nothing extra to prepare for quizzes. They read the papers and magazines, watch TV, and become quizzers because they enjoy the test of recall.</li>
<li>It was a test the nation took when KBC fever was at its height. But long before KBC, there were quiz societies across the country, in places from Guwahati to Gandhinagar. Kolkata was the hub of the game; quizzing in India began here in 1967. Even now, the majority of quizzers are from Kolkata. Of the four 2002 Mastermind finalists, two were from that city.</li>
<li>Quizzing is big in school and college festivals. It's the 'literary' highlight of all fests. There are even professional quizzers, who, like mercenaries, play for money and the thrill of the game. They represent various organisations at different times.</li>
<li>Most quizzers grow out of active quizzing after college. Some, the really hardcore devotees of the game, keep at it. "I don't get tired of quizzing," says Pinaki Prasad Roy, a Mastermind finalist. "I get excited." Roy is a 46-year old finance professional from Kolkata, and has been a quizzer for three decades.</li>
<li>Curiosity is the most essential quality for a quizzer. A fantastic memory and instant recall help. And for Mastermind at least, the choice of specialist subject is critical. In this year's event, Janardhana took an unassailable lead in the specialist round itself.</li>

Living with foods
<ol>
<li>Floods are not new to India and this sub-continent, but in recent years the problem has received much greater attention perhaps largely because it has led to much greater damage than in the past. Even though information on the impending occurrence of floods is now more accurate and certainly more timely, often there is very little time or support infrastructure in place by which damage can be minimized. This is particularly true in the case of flash floods resulting from sudden and excessively heavy rain.</li>
<li>In the case of India flooding is very much a function of the seasonal nature of our rainfall. The monsoons are spread over a short period during the year and often bring a concentrated volume of rain, which cannot be absorbed by the earth and finds outlet only in the form of streams that join up with our major river systems. But, flooding is not confined only to the main rivers of the country, often smaller tributaries and streams can cause heavy damage as well. Once these streams spill over their banks they could cause excessive harm, mainly because those living near the banks of these streams particularly in mountain areas do not have easy recourse to moving away quickly.</li>
<li>One major factor that could lead to a higher severity of flooding in the future is the danger of climate change. While the evidence of the nature of impacts resulting from climate change on precipitation and flooding at the regional level is not entirely clear, it could happen that the Indian subcontinent witnesses and suffers the effects of a significantly changed pattern of monsoons. One set of scientists has estimated that the monsoons could be shorter in duration, but far more intensive. In other words, much greater precipitation would take place in a much shorter period of time, thereby increasing the danger of floods. Climate change is the result of human actions through the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, of which carbon dioxide is the most prominent.</li>
<li>At the local level also human actions have heightened the danger of flood through the cutting of trees in the mountains as well as in the plains. In the case of India, the ecological damage through deforestation of the Himalayas has led to large-scale erosion of the mountain slopes and high levels of siltation. This leads to deposition of silt on the riverbeds in the plains and hence spill over of water whenever the volume in the river reaches a certain level. With siltation on the river beds, flooding occurs even at very shallow water levels. The vulnerability of the population has increased substantially because of population pressures, symbolized, for instance, by the stubborn and perhaps helpless settling of slum dwellers on the banks of the river Yamuna in Delhi, which is merely a trickle most of the year, but bursting its banks during the monsoons as has been the case this year.</li>
<li>Flood forecasting is critical to minimizing the damage from floods. It is for this reason that the Central Water Commission has set up a network of forecasting stations, which cover the most important flood prone inter state rivers in the country. These stations produce forecasts that are used to alert the public and to mobilize various official agencies so that they take both preventive as well as relief measures whenever required. However, even in cases where forecasts have been timely and generally accurate, people have often been reluctant to move away, because in most cases they lack the means and physical options for moving away from a danger zone to one that is relatively safe. In the case of flash floods, forecasts are difficult to make, and often the time available for relief is very short.</li>

Great Indian digital divide
<ol>
<li>The revolution in information technology (IT), far from helping India to leapfrog to a post-industrial society, threatens to rupture the social fabric by enriching a few at the cost of many.</li>
<li>In a very short time and quite unexpectedly, India has risen to considerable eminence in the world of information technology. This year, software products are expected to account for $ 5.7 billion in exports and will account for a quarter of the growth in the economy, which is expected to grow nearly seven per cent. Within eight years, predicts a recent study by McKinsey &amp; Co. and the National Association of Software &amp; Service Companies (Nasscom), India's annual IT exports could hit $ 50 billion about 33 per cent of global software exports. Such a surge is expected to generate 2.2 million jobs-and push our growth rate near the double digits that many East Asian Tigers enjoyed before the 1997 crash.</li>
<li>For the rapidly growing middle class, which was desperate to make its presence felt but remained mired in the great Indian outback of the global economy and regretfully watched the industrial revolution pass it by, this is the moment they have been waiting for. When countries like Japan and Germany, the objects of Indian admiration, should come knocking on our doors to solicit our talent to invigorate their industry, it is indeed redemption of sorts. And IT is the cause of it all.</li>
<li>The big question is, will IT do an encore for India as a nation, and not just for a wafer thin percentage of IT-literate Indians, mostly the poster boys of the IITs?</li>
<li>IT has, as yet, failed to touch the lives of the average citizen and India is nowhere close to being a knowledge economy or society. As per the International Data Corporation (IDC), in a survey of 55 countries, India ranks 54th on its Information Society Index.</li>
<li>The fact is, it is a straightforward reflection of the deep inequality of our education system which breeds a few 'geniuses' at the cost of the entire nation. A study by former director of the National Centre for Software Technology, R. Narasimhan, points out that nowhere is the digital divide more glaring than in IT education. The report warns that India's 'obsession' with the software industry and its exports orientation is leading to the churning out of unemployable students on one hand and bright whiz-kids on the other. While the latter are lured away by overseas employers, the former remain unemployable.<br />
Narasimhan cautions against the 'hype' associated with the phenomenal growth of India's software industry defying rational explanations and built up into a 'mystique of sort' which breeds false hopes. .</li>
<li>India's software industry is a poor employment generator. In the mid-Nineties, some 20,000 people were actively employed in software export services. In contrast, there were three million registered unemployed graduates in the Nineties. While the &#8216;Narasimhan study doesn&#8217;t mention number of hobs lost due to computerisation, one could comfortably add a million to the number.</li>

Deleterious effects of drugs
<ol>
<li>"Cured yesterday of my disease, I died last night of my physician," says Matthew Prior, a celebrated pharmacologist, while talking about the deleterious effects of drugs in his book, "The Remedy Worse Than the Disease". There is no dearth of patients dying of misguided treatment.</li>
<li>disorder bound to disappear in a short duration.</li>
<li>In this era of drugs we must familiarise ourselves with the term "Iatrogenic disease (physician caused ailment)". When a physician administers medicines without a complete understanding of the patient's condition, drugs play havoc. A person may become the victim of a worse disease or even lose his life.</li>
<li>With Analgin, for instance, special precautions should be taken in case of pregnancy, bronchial asthma, renal and hepatitic dysfunctions and blood-related disorders. It has been banned in several countries, including the USA and Sweden, because of its unexpected and negative effects that lead one even to death through an anaphylactic shock. An anaphylactic shock is a process that leads to a severe fall in the blood pressure, bronchoconstriction, the swelling of blood and lymph vessels and sometimes death because of the loss of fluid in these vessels. Anaphylaxis usually occurs suddenly, in minutes after the administration of a drug. The well-known drug, penicillin, and many other drugs, may cause anaphylaxis.</li>
<li>The term "side-effects" is a part of an ailing layman's vocabulary but adverse drug reactions are known only to a more aware and literate patient.</li>
<li>Ciprofloxacin, when given for an ear-infection, may cause vertigo and amoxycillin, while fighting a throat infection, may hurt the stomach. Similarly, while chemotherapy given for cancer may lead to indigestion and hair fall, steroids administered continuously may lead to obesity and diabetes.</li>
<li>Drugs are meant to eliminate disease. In the quest for avoiding the misery of sickness, man has invented medicines that may themselves cause diseases. The illness caused by a drug may be short-term or long-term. Side effects are short-term and predictable. The unpredictable and bizarre reactions are termed as adverse reactions. A variety of drugs cure many ills but are also known to cause irregular heart beat and even sudden death.</li>
<li>A strong sense of responsibility on the physician's part and an attitude of extreme caution on the patient's part can substantially help in covering at least some of the risks of medicines, if not all. There are many factors that help a doctor in his choice and use of the drug. The medical history of a patient, age, sex, personality, environment and education contribute in deciding the course of treatment. The very old and the very young are likely to suffer as their bodies are less tolerant. Older children may sometimes be more tolerant than the adults. The elderly tend to respond better to standard drug dosage. But the lower body size, slow blood flow to vital organs, decreasing metabolic capacity and tendency to multiple physical problems contribute to adverse reactions.</li>

Saving for a rainy day
<ol>
<li>The Food Bill is still in the works but has provoked a furious debate on the lack of grain storage facilities, rotting of grains and whether they should be distributed free to the hungry masses. Waking up to the fact that no food security programme can be effective without proper storage, the government is now planning to upgrade existing warehousing facilities and also adding new ones. However, between food security and large-scale storage, there's a missing link that needs to be taken note of: storage at the farm level. No one can deny the importance of decentralised storage; at least 25-30 per cent grains in the country are stored at the farm level.</li>
<li>However, it's not as if there hasn't been enough thrust on this issue: there are State institutes to look into the storage problems.</li>
<li>Yet, policy-wise we did have a sound start: the Save Grain Campaign, which was initiated 43 years ago, was supposed to do what we are floundering on now. Through this campaign, the Centre was to initiate and train states in warehousing and storage of grains. The Centre wanted the states to take it up on a large scale but the latter did not want any "added responsibility". Finding no takers, the campaign was withdrawn in 2008.</li>
<li>"Around 15-20 per cent foodgrain losses occur in large storage godowns. Along with investment in large storage capacities, we must encourage farm-level storage. This can be in the form of refining and improving the local/indigenous storage technologies and providing technical and financial support at that level," says M.B. Chetti, Dean, College of Agriculture, University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, Karnataka.</li>
<li>He and many experts like him suggest that if we want to leapfrog in storage capacity at the farm-level (since setting up large storages is time-consuming and expensive), new technologiese vacuum packaging could be the answer. They assure quality as well as a chance to store grains almost anywhere and that it can be done in villages by trained persons.</li>
<li>"Alternatively, we have to go for cold storage facilities for food grains, which is very costly since it involves electricity supply," says Chetti. Instead, vacuum packing, say experts, helps preserve grains and seeds for long periods without any deterioration in quality. In fact, an experiment was carried out in the university on the usefulness of the packaging system (using chilli) and the results were satisfactory. The available technology offers a seven- layer packing to preserve quality for long periods of time and once sealed, climatic changes have no effect on it. Elimination of oxygen from the pack helps in extending shelf life.</li>
<li>"At present only three-layer plastic films are manufactured in India. The seven-layered film needs to be imported. But the import duty is high," says Mohan Bajikar, of course, such technologies are expensive, but then delivering to the hungry isn't enough-quality must be ensured.</li>
<li>Fool policy analyst Devinder Sharma, however, says expensive solutions like silos and warehousing are not the answer to procurement and storage problems. Instead, he says, "local production, local procurement and local distribution" is the answer, something like what Chhattisgarh has been doing. It procures paddy directly from farmers, buying it through cooperative societies and procurement centres at the village level. To store, he adds, the government can add a small godown next to each panchayat ghar.</li>
<li>Whichever way we look at it, decentralised storage cannot be left out of the loop if we want to ensure food security and reduce stock losses.</li>

The relevance of repetition
<ol>
<li>The painstaking memorisation of mathematical tables, historical dates, capitals of countries and even poems leaves an indelible mark on every adult who has attented school. However, all educators deprecate this rote system learning by orally reciting and consigning lessons to memory as mindless and mechanical, which goes against critical thinking and creativity. But is this dichotomy between creativity and rote learning part of a lazy binary thinking?</li>
<li>We often hear about people who can repeat the entire telephone directory or memorise the entire dictionary. Indians have a history of highly developed systems of memorisation, perfected through centuries of Vedic learning. From a typically Western perspective, the permanency of the written word has been pitted against the 'unconscious operation of memory' of oral cultures, and held to be more reliable in cultural transmission. However, refuting this thesis, Fritz Stall, an Indie scholar observes that the oral tradition in India is remarkable, "because it has led to scientific discoveries that are of enduring interest". Of course, this mugging up can be aural (i.e. chanting aloud) or visual-mentally storing images in a visual map.</li>
<li>The advantages of rote memorisation-like it expands areas of the mind to great possibilities-are now becoming evident to the world. Various accounts from ancient India, including those from travellers like I-tsing, point to the fool-proof system of oral memorisation and the capacity to absorb volumes of data.</li>
<li>A parallel dimension of transmission of knowledge also existed in India, with a flexible mode of oral communication through which knowledge was disseminated. One instance is the narrative-performative tradition of recitation, which extended basic story through interpolations, conscious extensions and embedding of sub-narratives. Many Indian myths, legends, epics, and fables such as Kathasaritsagara and Jataka stories were spread though this process. While the story remains the same, the interpretation changes according to who says it, where it is said and how it is said. While communicating mathematics, philosophy and other scientific disciplines, cryptic text forms were created, that facilitated memorisation.</li>
<li>A related question pertains to cognition-how can we transmit principles using memorisation as a creative tool rather than as a mechanical process of repetition? Bhaskara's Lilavati, the seminal 12th century illustrates how memorisation and creativity go together.</li>
<li>The fact that Bhaskara's methods still figure in Indian pedagogic consciousness was recently brought home in a news report on the Ramanujan School of Mathematics in Patna, which trains youngsters from poor families to clear the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) entrance test. This year, all the 30 students of the school got through IITs. Anand Kumar, the school's founder, called it the "sheer power of practice to break the so-called IIT code" and a student attributed the success to his teacher's ability to teach differential calculus through a "thrilling story of a daring robber".</li>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Note-Making</strong></span><br />
Notes are short written record of facts to aid the memory. Notes are usually taken to record a speech or dictation while listening to it or after reading a book, magazine or article. They are referred back whenever needed and may be reproduced in the desired way.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The necessity of note-making</strong></span><br />
Knowledge is vast and unlimited, but our memory is limited. We cannot remember all the information all the time. Hence note-making is necessary. With the help of notes we can recall the entire information read/heard months ago. Note-making is quite useful to students preparing so many subjects. At the time of examinations, it is not possible to go through voluminous books. At such critical times, notes are quite handy. Hence note-making fulfils three useful functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>It keeps a lot of information at our disposal for ready reference.</li>
<li>It helps us reconstruct what was said or written and thus accelerates the process of remembering/recall. .</li>
<li>It comes in handy in delivering a speech, participation in a debate/discussion, writing an essay and revising lessons before an examination.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>How note-making helps us</strong></span><br />
While making notes we do not simply read the passage/listen to speech but consider various points made by the writer/speaker and draw our own inferences about what is being presented. Thus note-making helps us in understanding the passage in a better way and organising our thoughts systematically.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Characteristics of good notes</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Short and Compact: Good notes must be short and compact.</li>
<li>Complete Information: They must contain all the important information.</li>
<li>Logical: They must be presented in a logical way.</li>
<li>Understandable: They should be understandable when consulted at a later stage.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Mechanics of note-making</strong></span><br />
While making notes we follow certain standard practices. These may be listed as follows:<br />
(a) Heading and Sub-headings<br />
(b) Abbreviation and Symbols<br />
(c) Note-form<br />
(d) Numbering and Indentation</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Heading and sub-headings</strong></span><br />
The heading reflects the main theme whereas the sub-headings point out how it has been developed. The selection of proper heading and sub-heading reveals the grasp of the passage by the students. In the absence of proper assimilation of main ideas and subsidiary points it is impossible to make notes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Abbreviations and symbols</strong></span><br />
They are used for precision and economy of words and hence quite helpful in note-making. At least four recognisable abbreviations are to be used in note-making in your board examination.<br />
These are essential components of note-making. Students often make use of abbreviations and symbols in doing their written work.<br />
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Confusing abbreviations should be avoided, e.g., the abbreviation 'under' may stand for understand, understood and understanding. Similarly 'indst' may stand for industry, industrial, industrious.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Note-Form</strong></span><br />
While making notes the whole information is listed in note-form in points only. Notes should not be written in complete sentences as we can't remember the whole information. So only the main points are listed one under the other and numbered.<br />
It implies the logical division and sub-division of the listed information by using figures, letters, dashes and spaces.<br />
All examples and figurative speeches are eliminated.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Numbering and indenting</strong></span><br />
Indentation
Indentation means leaving space at the beginning of a line of print or writing.<br />
First write the title and then write down the notes in a logical order. From the main headings to the sub-headings, the numbering should be spaced a little to the right.<br />
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br />
Note-making is a useful skill. You must develop it with constant practice. Notes form an essential part of your academic life and will serve you well in your School/Board examinations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>How to make notes</strong></span><br />
Follow the following steps:<br />
<strong>Step 1 :</strong> (i)Read the passage carefully.<br />
(ii)Try to get the theme and subject of the passage. You may ask yourself: "What is this passage about?" This will provide you the gist.<br />
<strong>Step 2 :</strong> Read carefully. Identify main ideas and important supporting details.<br />
<strong>Step 3 :</strong> Make notes of the main ideas under headings and add sub-points under sub-headings.<br />
<strong>Step 4 :</strong> Use proper layout/format, e.g.,<br />
(a) Indented, linear form<br />
(b) Sequential form<br />
(c) Tabular form<br />
(d) Flow chart<br />
(e) Pie chart, graphs or diagrams, etc.<br />
<strong>Step 5 :</strong> Use recognisable abbreviations wherever possible</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Conversation is indeed the most easily teachable of all arts. All you need to do in order to become a good conversationalist is to find a subject that interests you and your listeners. There are, for example, numberless hobbies to talk about. But the important<br />
thing is that you must talk about other fellow's hobby rather than your own. Therein lies the secret of your popularity. Talk to your friends about the things that interest them, and you will get a reputation for good fellowship, charming wit, and a brilliant mind. There is nothing that pleases people so much as your interest in their interest.</li>
<li>It is just as important to know what subjects to avoid and what subjects to select for good conversation. If you don't want to be set down as a wet blanket or a bore, be careful to avoid certain unpleasant subjects. Avoid talking about yourself, unless you are asked to do so. People are interested in their own problems not in yours. Sickness or death bores everybody. The only one who willingly listens to such talk is the doctor, but he gets paid for it.</li>
<li>To be a good conversationalist you must know not only what to say, but how also to say it. Be mentally quick and witty. But don't hurt others with your wit. Finally try to avoid mannerism in your conversation. Don't bite your lips or click your tongue, or roll your eyes or use your hands excessively as you speak.</li>
<li>Don't be like that Frenchman who said, "How can I talk if you hold my hand?"</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>A good business letter is one that gets results. The best way to get results is to develop a letter that, in its appearance, style and content, conveys information efficiently. To perform this function, a business letter should be concise, clear and courteous.</li>
<li>The business letter must be concise: don't waste words. Little introduction or preliminary chat is necessary. Get to the point, make the point, and leave it. It is safe to assume that your letter is being read by a very busy person with all kinds of papers to deal with. Re-read and revise your message until the words and sentences you have used are precise. This takes time, but is a necessary part of a good business letter. A short business letter that makes its point quickly has much more impact on a reader than a long-winded, rambling exercise in creative writing. This does not mean that there is no place for style and even, on occasion, humour in the business letter. While it conveys a message in its contents, the letter also provides the reader with an impression of you, its author: the medium is part of the message.</li>
<li>The business letter must be clear. You should have a very firm idea of what you want to say, and you should let the reader know it. Use the structure of the letter-the paragraphs, topic sentences, introduction and conclusion-to guide the reader point by point from your thesis, through your reasoning, to your conclusion. Paragraph often, to break up the page and to lend an air of organisation to the letter. Use an accepted business-letter format. Re-read what you have written from the point of view of someone who is seeing it for the first time, and be sure that all explanations are adequate, all information provided (including reference numbers, dates, and other identification). A clear message, clearly delivered, is the essence of business communication.</li>
<li>The business letter must be courteous. Sarcasm and insults are ineffective and can often work against you. If you are sure you are right, point that out as politely as possible, explain why you are right, and outline what the reader is expected to do about it. Another form of courtesy is taking care in your writing and typing of the business letter. Grammatical and spelling errors (even if you call them typing errors) tell a reader that you don't think enough of him or can lower the reader's opinion of your personality faster than anything you say, no matter how idiotic. There are excuses for ignorance; there are no excuses for sloppiness.</li>
<li>The business letter is your custom-made representative. It speaks for you and is a permanent record of your message. It can pay big dividends on the time you invest in giving it a concise message, a clear structure, and a courteous tone.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Good decoration reflects the personality of the people who live in the home. It should, first of all, be distinctive, just as each person is distinctive. A home should have unity<br />
not only within each room but also throughout the house. Rooms should, to some degree, harmonize with each other. The colour and styling of each room, particularly, should fit into the colour and styling of the rooms which run out of it.</li>
<li>Attractive home furnishings set the stage for pleasant living. If they are an expression of yourself, you will have a feeling of satisfaction every time you enter your home, and friends will share your enjoyment.</li>
<li>However, furnishings and surroundings expressive of just the right note of restfulness, gay informality, or elegant simplicity are not often assembled by accident. Even enthusiasm alone is not enough. For most home decorators, it takes poring over plans, trying colour schemes, finding ingenious ways to make the best of what you have, and shopping around to search out just the right purchases at prices you can afford to pay. But there is keen pleasure in striving for the perfect result, and great satisfaction in achieving it.</li>
<li>A successful house and successful rooms will depend upon the proper relationship of each element in it to the others and to the whole. Therefore, in selecting each piece it is well to consider the background, the usage, the draperies, the floor covering, the upholstering materials, the woods, shapes, colour scheme, and the "feeling" you prefer for the room.</li>
<li>Work and plan to enjoy your house. Limit the expenditures of time, effort and money to the extent of your abilities, so that just running the house doesn't dominate your life. Elegance and delicate things may be a drain you can afford only in a limited way. If you can't afford outside help, select a house and furnishings that require less care. Plan your activities so that tumult and upset are limited to a few rooms-an activity room or a bedroom, or a comer of the dining room.</li>
<li>You'll get more pleasure out of a house if you have a hobby connected with it-collecting glass or antiques, gardening or indoor flower growing ceramics, art, cooking, decorating, flower arrangements, etc. And you'll get more satisfaction and a great deal of help from studying household activities.</li>
<li>You can select a pleasing combination of colours from a wallpaper, a fabric, an oriental mg, a flower or scene, or even a picture in a magazine. If you don't already have the furniture or mgs, it is a good idea to make up a colour scheme in this way. Let one colour predominate. Limit a colour scheme to two or three colours, with white or gray tones.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>These points will help you:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Always choose colours that please you personally- subtle, calm colours if you prefer a restful atmosphere, intense colours if you like liveliness and cheer.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid of colour. Experimenting on paper will give you confidence. (But remember larger batches of colour are more intense.) Try out various colour combinations, then live with them-look at them frequently before you actually start buying.</li>
<li>Colours should harmonize with furniture, draperies, carpets.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
EXERCISE YOUR WAY TO A HEALTHY HEART
<ol>
<li>The epidemic of heart attacks has been attaining alarming proportion in recent times causing grave concern specially to the medical fraternity.</li>
<li>To contain and control the increasing death and disability from heart attacks and to focus on public awareness and their involvement at global level, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Heart Federation observed September 24th as the World Heart Day.</li>
<li>What causes heart attacks? Dr H.S. Wasir, Chief Cardiologist and Medical Director, Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre lists four main habits which adversely affect the heart health. These are lack of physical exercise, wrong eating habits, cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and stressful lifestyle.</li>
<li>The importance of physical exercise in minimising the incidence of heart attacks cannot be underestimated. "Physical exercise," says Dr Wasir, "plays a major role in achieving a long and healthy life in general and prevention of heart attacks in particular." There are several studies showing that physically active people have higher longevity than those sedentary or physically inactive.</li>
<li>In fact, the review of modern medical literature sums up the role of physical activity in health as 'Regular physical exercise adds not only years to life but also life to years'. It is the experience of many modern day physicians that some patients of angina (chest pain or discomfort on physical or mental exertion or after meals) do get relief with regularly done physical exercise.</li>
<li>What type of physical exercise and how much, one may ask. It is the isotonic (dynamic) exercise that is beneficial for the heart and not the isometric (static) exercise which should be avoided by heart patients. Weight lifting, carrying heavy suitcases while travelling, pushing a car are some of the examples of isometric exercises. Examples of the beneficial type of physical activity (dynamic exercise) are brisk walking, swimming, golf without power carts, badminton and tennis (doubles for those with old heart attacks but fully recovered, to be started only after physician's advice).</li>
<li>Walking is the best mode of doing regular physical exercise which requires no equipment, money, material or membership of a club! 30 to 60 minutes brisk walk even on alternate day has been proven to be beneficial. Stationary cycling or walking on a treadmill at home are the other alternatives.</li>
<li>Walking up the stairs instead of using a lift if going up to three or four floors or getting off the lift two or three floors before the destination and walking up the rest through stairs. Going up several floors in a overcrowded lift with limited fresh air to be shared by so many may also prove unhealthy.</li>
<li>Park a little away from the work place and walk that healthy distance.</li>
<li>Best time for brisk walks would be the early mornings before the traffic flow picks up and walking in the parks with thick plantation. Jogging on the roads with heavy traffic should be avoided as you will be inhaling air polluted with the toxins from vehicular exhaust such as dioxides of sulphur and nitrogen.</li>
<li>"Before starting any physical exercise programmes for the first time, one must get fully evaluated by a cardiologist so as to avoid any harm being done by exercise if there is serious underlying heart disease needing treatment," warns Dr Wasir.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Scientists in the USA and Japan are developing a set of smart materials that clean themselves off dirt and stains besides eliminating foul odours and dangerous bacteria.</li>
<li>Exploiting powerful catalytic properties, researchers succeeded in creating tiles, glass, paint, paper and cloth that can keep themselves sparkling clean.</li>
<li>The first item to reach the market, a self-cleaning wall and counter tile, can not only kill bacteria but also eliminate odours and staining associated with smoke from cooking oils and cigarettes, reports the journal Technology Review.</li>
<li>The key to the self-cleansing world of the future is the interaction between titanium dioxide and ultraviolet rays from the sun or fluorescent lights. The special properties of titanium dioxide-a substance used to make paint and tooth-paste white-were first discovered by Tokyo University chemist Akira Fujishima and Associates in 1969. Their research showed that when exposed to solar energy, titanium dioxide has the ability to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen.</li>
<li>After a quarter-century of observation, scientists now understand that the reaction occurs as titanium dioxide absorbs ergy from the UV band of sunlight and reacts with water vapour in the air to produce oxygen molecules. These molecules are energetic enough to break down organic matter into carbon dioxide and trace elements.</li>
<li>"When light shines on the white paint pigment, titanium dioxide, it produces an active form of oxygen that can burn combustible material at room temperature," says David Ollis, Professor of Chemical Engineering at North Carolina State University. "It is a fire without a flame."</li>
<li>Scientists have discovered that titanium dioxide-coated materials can easily remove thin deposits such as bacteria and fingerprints, though they are unable to break down thick splotches of organic materials-such as blood stains-because light and oxygen in the air cannot reach the surface where the reaction occurs.</li>
<li>Fujishima says that when titanium-dioxide tiles were used in the operating rooms and bathrooms of Ako Central Hospital in Ako, Japan, they killed 99.9 per cent of bacteria on their surface. Included among them were penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus and other germs that can cause secondary infections among patients.</li>
<li>The tiles-marketed by Japan's Toto Corp under the name NeoClean-remain effective even though they are coated with a layer of titanium dioxide only one micron thick, about one-fiftieth the diameter of a human hair. Once the fine layer of compound is permanently affixed-it is commonly sprayed and then baked onto the tile's surface- the company says it is resistant to the abrasion of ordinary scrubbing that might be needed for thicker stains. Moreover, because titanium dioxide acts only as a catalyst for the photochemical reaction, it theoretically never gets used up.</li>
<li>While cleaning time varies with the thickness of the deposit, Adam Heller, a professor of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin, says his experiment shows that titanium dioxide-treated glass removed fingerprints in about two hours. This glass, versions of which both Heller and Fujishima have developed, could be made reactive on both sides, making it ideal for everything from sky-scraper windows to car window glass.</li>
<li>The Japanese have tested other titanium dioxide-treated materials as well. Kazuhito Hashimoto, a chemist at Tokyo University, applied the compound to a porcelain urinal. After a month, the treated urinal looked sparkling clean while an untreated unit was blotched and yellowed. Elsewhere, researchers are experimenting to see if the tiles can keep themselves clean on the walls of heavily polluted car and truck tunnels. And a Japanese paper company is developing windows and partitions for Japanese houses while a camping equipment manufacturer is testing a self-cleaning tent fabric.</li>
<li>But the most promising self-cleaning product is likely to be a wash-itself paint. Both the Texas and the Tokyo laboratories have demonstrated the self-cleaning capacities of paints containing titanium dioxide. While they are not saying exactly how they did it, both claim to have overcome an intrinsic problem in which titanium dioxide breaks down materials that bind pigments in coloured paints.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>It's headache having a headache. Almost all of us have suffered from a headache at some time or the other. For some headache is a constant companion and life can be a painful hell of wasted time.</li>
<li>The most important step to cope with headaches is to identify the type of headache one is suffering from. In tension headaches (two hand headache), a feeling of a tight band around the head exists along with pain in the neck and shoulders. It usually follows activities such as long stretches of driving, typing or sitting on the desk. They are usually short-timed, but can last for days or weeks?</li>
<li>A headache is usually caused due to spinal misalignment of the head, due to poor posture. Sleeping on the stomach with the head turned to one side and bending over positions for a long time make it worse.</li>
<li>In migraine headaches (one handed headaches), the pain is usually on one side of the head and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, irritability and bright spots of flashes of light. This headache is made worse by activity, especially bending. The throbbing pain in the head gets worse by noise and light. Certain triggers for migraines may be chocolate, caffeine, smoking or MSU in certain food items. The pain may last from eight to 24 hours and there may be a hangover for two-three days.</li>
<li>Migraines are often preceded by an aura-changes in sight and sensation. There is usually a family history of migraine.</li>
<li>In a headache the pain originates not from the brain but from irritated nerves of muscles, blood vessels and bones. These send pain signals to the brain which then judges the degree of distress and relays it at appropriate sites. The pain may sometimes be referred to sites other than the problem areas. This is known as referred pain and occurs due to sensation overload. Thus, though most headaches start at the base of the skull the referred pain is felt typically behind the eyes.</li>
<li>Factors causing headaches are not fully understood but it is known that a shift in the level of body hormones and chemicals, certain food and drinks and environmental stress can trigger them.</li>
<li>If headaches trouble you often, visit the doctor, who will take a full health history relating to diet, lifestyle stresses, the type of headache, triggering factors and relief measures. You may be asked to keep a "headache diary" which tells you to list the time the headache started, when it ended, emotional, environmental and food and drink factors which may have contributed to it. The type and severity of pain and the medications used which provided most relief, are also to be listed.</li>
<li>This helps the doctor in determining the exact cause and type of headache and the type of drugs to use. Apart from this a physical examination is done to rule out any serious underlying cause. The blood pressure is recorded, vision tested and muscle coordination o; the eyes is checked to rule out these as causes. Blood tests may be done to rule out anaemia, diabetes and thyroid disease. If any of the above is abnormal or otherwise a CT Scan or MRI may be done to see tissues and structures around the brain. These will rule out causes such as tumors, haemorrhage and infection of the brain, this examination gives a clear picture of the problem to the doctor.</li>
<li>Immediate relief can be obtained by certain medications and a few simple self-care techniques. Using ice against the pain site, covering eyes with dark glasses, drinking plenty of fluids and lying down in a dark and quiet room, provide relief in a migraine attack. Pain killers like aspirin, ibuprofen (brufen) and crocin can be taken and provide relief in different proportions. These should be used with caution and under medical supervision, if used for long periods and large quantities as all of them can cause many side effects. An antiemetic like perinorm can help the nausea associated with a migraine.</li>

<p><strong>Answer</strong><br />
<strong>2.2</strong> All of us suffer from headache. It can be of many types. The tension headache is short lived. But there can be headache due to body posture. Migraine headache is caused due to nausea, vomitting and irritability. In headache pain starts from irritated nerves of muscles; blood vessels and bones. There are many other factors like food environment and body postures that may result in a headache. It can be cured through physical examination of doctor. Other diseases like B.P., diabetes may also be got checked. The best technique is to have self care or to use pain killers as per prescription of the doctor.</p>

<li>It is an unpretentious structure tucked in a comer of Chandni Chowk. It could be missed by a passer-by but for the chirping which gives away its unique mission. The Charity Birds Hospital is the only one of its kind in the country. Many people arrive here daily with injured birds which they may have found lying by the roadside. After a quick inspection, an attendant makes a simple entry in the register: name of the person, kind of bird and date and "admits the patient" for treatment free of cost. The bird then becomes the sole responsibility of the hospital.</li>
<li>The ailing bird is administered first-aid and then kept in an isolated cage. Often medication and proper care is all that is needed. After the wound heals, the bird is moved to a common section with other birds of its kind. Soon it will be healthy enough to fly away, may keep visiting the terrace for food and water. The work began way back in 1929 in a small one-room structure. One Lala Lachumal Jain, along with others, decided to start a medical facility for birds. A few years later it became increasingly difficult to treat the large number of birds being brought. In 1957 the present building was inaugurated.</li>
<li>The progress of the hospital has been slow but steady. Till 1968 only ayurvedic treatment was being administered. Allopathy was adopted that year. And it was as recently as in 1992 that a laboratory was set up to conduct pathological tests. Though surgery is conducted at times and doctors try their best to save the bird's life, it is often too late. The mortality rate is quite high: around five to six birds die everyday.</li>
<li>The hospital survives only on charity. The trustees proudly claim that there is a steady flow of donations. Rich businessmen, visitors and even tourists donate generously. Till date they have never approached the government for funds. However, the hospital has drawbacks. It does not accept carnivorous birds and does not admit pet birds. Moreover, the bird is subjected to a lot of stress as, being in old Delhi, the place is not easily accessible. Since it survives on charity, it is unable to take up research work.</li>
<li>But work goes on. The staff says, they have received as many as 50-60 cases a day. The hospital has an emergency ward and stays open round the clock. It spends approximately ? <span class="_Tgc">₹</span> 6 lakh to ? ₹ 7 lakh annually and at any given time looks after 4000 to 5000 birds.</li>

<li>The term earthquake is applied to any tremor or shaking of the ground. Many earthquakes are so gentle as to pass almost unrecognised, others are sufficiently pronounced to excite general alarm, while some spread enormous destruction. Destructive earthquakes are usually confined to limited regions. The usual phenomena recorded in well-known earthquakes are first a trembling, next one or more severe shocks, and then a trembling which gradually dies away. In most cases, each shock lasts only a few seconds, but the tremblings that follow may continue for days, weeks, or even months. Noises of various kinds usually accompany an earthquake. They have been likened to the howling of storm, the growling of thunder, the clanking and clashing of iron chains, or the rumbling of heavy wagons along a road. Such noises are conducted through the ground, or thev may travel through the sea or air, and are often heard at great distances from the place where the shock is felt. Some earthquakes, however, are not accompanied by these noises. At the time of the terrible shock which destroyed Riobamba in Ecuador on February 4, 1797, a complete silence reigned.</li>
<li>Many changes are produced on the earth's surface by earthquakes. They cause landslips and cracks in the earth, which will sometimes alter the drainage system of a country. They are frequently accompanied by great seawaves, which will often sweep rocks and sand great distances inland. Permanent elevations and depressions of land are sometimes caused. After the great earthquakes of 1750, the coast of Chili was found to have been permanently raised from three to four feet. Well-known examples of permanent depressions are those of the Runn of Kutch and the coastlands near Chittagong, which suddenly sank during the Bengal earthquake of 1762.</li>
<li>Earthquakes are the most common in volcanic and mountainous regions, and many of them are no doubt due to volcanic action. These appear to originate in the sea, and may be due to the flashing into steam of the water which finds its way down through cracks to the underlying heated rocks. Others appear to originate in volcanoes themselves, being due to the explosion of vapours which expand. Many other causes are ascribed, of which two may be mentioned. Some earthquakes may be due to the collapse of hollows beneath the ground, and others again to the snapping of strata which has been subjected to too great a strain. It is noticeable that most earthquakes occur during the cold months of winter.</li>
<li>Among destructive earthquakes in modern times may be mentioned the one that altered the Straits of Messina between Italy and Sicily in 1908, and the terrible upheaval in Japan in 1925, which destroyed whole towns and caused the death of thousands of people.</li>

<p><strong>2.2</strong> Earthquake takes place due to tremor or shaking of the ground. Some earthquakes are so gentle that these are known unrecognised while some spread destruction. Destructive earthquakes are noisy, linked to the howling of storm, the growling of thunder, the clanking and clashing of iron chains. Many earthquakes also cause land slips and cracks in the earth that sometimes affect the drainage system of the country. In volcanic and mountainous regions, earthquakes are common. It is also noted that most earthquake occur during winter.</p>

<ol>
<li>The one industry that remains unaffected by any depression in trade is the beauty industry. The women world over continue to spend money on their faces and bodies even when there is a great slump in other areas of trade. The number of advertisements proclaiming the miracles performed by the various beauty aids goes to support the fact that, today, with all the talk about emancipation, equality of sexes and feminism, women are still observed with their physical beauty as they were in the times of Cleopatra.</li>
<li>America leads the figures, literally and metaphorically. Many parts of Europe by virtue of being affected by political and economic instability, leave precious little for women to beautify themselves. May be, all that women in Europe, can then do is to wash and hope for the best. But, the rich and upper middle class women, everywhere in the world, block a substantial amount of their income on beautifying themselves. Why is it so?</li>
<li>The richer the man gets the more obsessed he becomes with high powered cars and electronic gadgets and bank balances. On the contrary, the women, especially the urban upper middle class women, find their bodies and faces worthy of investing a major part of their income.</li>
<li>Women, these days, are much freer than they were in the last century. Not only are they free to take part in social and professional functions of a society as an equal to man, but also to look attractive in any given situation. The beauty industry is shrewd enough to exploit this trend and women in every walk of life have something to buy from the range of products that the beauty industry offers. The British matron, today, is the thing of the past.</li>
<li>As a result of the number of beauty parlours that have sprung up in every street corner of the metropolises, and the exercises, the health motors and the skin foods that they offer, you can hardly run into an old woman these days. One could say 'old ladies' are fast becoming an extinct species. White hair, wrinkles, bent backs and hollow cheeks are features of a bygone era. Cosmetic surgery has slowly eradicated these unwanted phenomena. If children of posterity want to look at an old woman, they might have to run to an art gallery and find a medieval painting.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>According to the National Council for Applied Economic Research's latest report, India&#8217;. Human Development Report which is a profile of the Indian states in the 1990s, there are many problems in women's education. Girls are taken out of school as soon as some calamity hits the family's fortunes. They are made to look after their younger siblings and they are not looked upon as 'investment'. In order to marry them off early and without problems, girls are not allowed to traverse long distances to go to schools. They are not allowed to study under male teachers. Affluent families invest in girls' education only if they are assured of getting better bridegrooms.</li>
<li>So high is the girls' drop out rate that there are only 52 girls to every 100 boys who complete middle school. Gender disparity is higher among matriculates and 40 women to every 100 men ever pass the examination. The only gender egalitarian state is Kerala and it is very difficult to come across a female graduate in a village excepting in Kerala. Gender disparity varies with household income and poverty level and the poorer the family, the greater the temptation to invest in boys' education. It also varies according to social class. The lowest level of matriculates is among the SC/STs and Muslims.</li>
<li>Another important finding is that at the critical age of 25 to 34 years, there is higher gender disparity in education, with high levels of female illiteracy, in the problematic central Indian states (Bihar, MP, Rajasthan and UP). This is indicative of other connected problems that these states face. When women are illiterate, they are not able to look after their children's health and the mortality rate may be high. Faced with a high mortality rate of children, there is a tendency to have more children and the fertility rate remains high. Among the SC/ST women in the reproductive age of 15 to 35, only 6 to 9 percentage of literacy can be found in Bihar and UP.</li>
<li>Female labour participation reveals that as soon as the family's income improves, women give up working whether in the fields or in non-farm activities or at home in income generating activities. It is not surprising that they stop working because there is a huge gender disparity in wage rates. Even when women do the same arduous work they are paid on average ? ₹ 17 a day as compared to ? ₹ 23 for men.</li>
<li>When women are educated they can at least look after their own and the family's health, better. Without adequate education, there is a low level of awareness about ailments and sheer ignorance can cause them to ascribe ailments to non-medical, often supernatural causes. Uneducated women are often too shy to reveal their diseases and many do not go to doctors out of fear that it may cause undue expenses to their budgetary balances. Pregnant women in many villages have been found not to be given any special diet. In fact they often reduce their food intake because of the prevailing belief that they cannot digest heavy food. There is gender disparity in most states in the treatment of young children and the elderly.</li>
<li>In any case, a majority of the rural areas do not have provision for primary health care services. The prevalence of diseases is rather high in the southern states, West Bengal and Punjab perhaps because of better reporting of sickness and the availability of treatment. About 41 million individuals receive medication for major illnesses at a point of time in India and the highest prevalence is of hypertension followed by tuberculosis. The critical issues of education and health are closely connected with expansion of job opportunities and while reducing unemployment has been a standard slogan during the elections by all parties, the emphasis on health and education has been subdued.</li>

<p><strong>2.2</strong> Women's education is still legging behind under various factors. If any calamity hits the family girls are taken out of school to look after their younger siblings. Girls education is not regard as investment. Only the rich class educate their girls for better match. Most of the parents do not like to send their girl child in distant school or taught by male teachers. The working womens give up their job with an increase in their family income. Secondly inadequate education in female create health problems due to ignorance, superstitions and fear of undue expense. There is lack of rural health care services so the rural women become victims of diseases like T.B., hypertension etc.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>The recently concluded Kyoto Conference on the production of gases with a greenhouse effect on the environment has again brought into focus the issue involving the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).</li>
<li>These are widely used for their cooling and propelling actions in equipment such as air- conditioners, fire extinguishers and refrigerators. Most of the CFCs are non-toxic, inert and non-inflammable, therefore, ideal for both domestic and commercial use. In medicine, their use is widespread for general purposes listed above. More specifically, they are used as propellants for inhalational drugs commonly used by patients with asthma and other lung diseases. Millions of patients using metered dose inhalers (MDI) are thus dependent on CFCs-until CFC-free inhalers become available.</li>
<li>The inhalational therapy, which almost revolutionised the management of asthma, is apparently in danger. It was in the 1970s when the scientists first discovered that the CFCs were dangerous for the environment. CFCs released in the environment are broken down by the sunlight to release chlorine atoms. It is the chlorine atom which destroys the ozone layer present about 40 km above the earth.</li>
<li>The effect is so potent that one atom of chlorine can destroy up to 100000 molecules of ozone.</li>
<li>The normally present ozone layer prevents the entry of the extra terrestrial rays on the earth. A hole created in this protective umbrella allows the harmful ultraviolet and other rays to pass unfiltered. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect resulting in global warming. The size of the hole which was supposedly of a football ground until a few years ago, has grown to that of Antarctica. That in itself speaks of the enormity of the problem.</li>
<li>The contribution of CFC propellants used in medicine to the greenhouse effect is negligible. CFCs used in inhalers are less than 0.5 per cent of its total worldwide use. In fact, propulsion of a single satellite in space releases more chlorine than that by the worldwide use of MDIs for a whole year. Even the Montreal Protocol which introduced total ban on CFCs had spared the essential uses such as that for MDIs.</li>
<li>But a ban on CFCs for most of their uses is bound to affect their inhalational therapy. Production of CFCs is likely to stop in the near future. Moreover, a relative scarcity of CFCs is likely to greatly increase the costs of inhalers. Alternative approaches, therefore, are immediately required.</li>
<li>Inhalational therapy is now established as an important method of administration of drugs. It is certainly the mainstay for treatment of asthma. But several other drugs, including antibiotics are administered in inhaled forms. CFCs are required only when a drug is available in a premixed form in a canister for direct inhalation. But drugs, other than those for asthma are not available as ready-made inhalers. Most of those drugs, including many used for asthma as well, are given by nebulization which involves the use of compressed air (or oxygen) to change the liquid solution into a vapour-form. But nebulization does not solve the problem as it cannot replace the inhalers.</li>
<li>Alternative propellant gases using fluorocarbons without a chlorine atom, are being developed. Fluorine released by these propellants is considered to be safe for the ozone layer. But inhalers employing such gases are yet not available.</li>
<li>Another novel technique is to substitute the liquid inhalational drug with a powdered form. Several kinds of dry-powder inhalers are already available in the market. The methodology is easy and simple for the patient but for the problem of dosage. Per dose the amount of drug which can be inhaled in a powder form is generally less than that from an MDI. We have différé .t rotahalers and rotacaps available in India. Elsewhere, in the world, there are disc-halers where a single disc contains multiple (six to eight) blisters of the drug, or a turbohaler where 100 to 200 dosages are made available in a single unit. It is only a question of time when these forms shall be marketed in this country as well. Those are bound to be costlier to absorb the expenses of research, development and marketing.</li>
<li>Undoubtedly, better alternatives will be developed in future. Until then, one hopes that the benefits of inhalational therapy with or without the use of CFCs are not denied to the patients.</li>

<li>This may seem like straight out of a Harry Potter book, but it happens to be true. The three thousand year old publishing medium &#8211; Paper, might soon get obsolete. Or, its use might get severely curtailed, with the arrival of electronic ink &#8211; a close cousin to the e-paper.</li>
<li>The functionality of the whole experiment lies in its simplicity. The new technology not only looks, feels and is portable like the conventional paper, but is also eco-friendly.</li>
<li>E-ink, a US based company is on the fast track of developing e-ink that looks just like grey paint, but inside there are hundreds and thousands of microcapsules, which change their colour from light to dark when exposed to an electronic field.</li>
<li>Since these microcapsules float free in an oil-based liquid &#8211; the "carrier medium", they can be printed on just about any flat surface, convex, concave or even cloth material. Currently, e-ink is hawking this technology only to the likes of JC Penney, which has begun to use its simplified versions for a futuristic promotional campaign. Commercial application is still a bend away. The primitive version of the technology was developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre and was promptly christened Gyricon (from a Greek word standing for rotate + image). This was because the technology involved floating microspheres.</li>
<li>The success formula behind the cutting-edge technology lies in the reusable paper that can 'typeset' itself through a wireless system, enabling updation of contents throughout the day-almost like a web update.</li>
<li>The fundamentals are so simple, it is amazing how it eluded scientists for so long. In a nutshell, it combines the clarity, userfriendliness and affordability of the conventional paper, with the immediacy of the Web and can even be folded and kept in the briefcase for an easy lugging to the office.</li>
<li>"There is a strong demand to retain all the good properties of paper and yet couple it with electronic distribution", says a senior scientist associated team on the company's Web site. In other words, if one is to replace paper, the electronic alternative should also look like paper. This might even please the strong environmentalists' lobby, who have always stood up in arms against the massive tree-felling by the paper industry. According to one conservative estimate, an average reader consumes nearly 740 pounds of paper pulp every year.</li>
<li>Another drawback with the paper industry is that the printed words are so static that they can neither be erased nor updated. The new technology creates a dynamic high resolution display over a thin and flexible medium and is expected to hit the market by 2003. It will perhaps herald an altogether new reading style with the paraphernalia of e-books and e-paper that can display volumes of information as easily as turning a page and permanent newspaper surfaces that update themselves daily via a wireless broadcast.</li>
<li>E-ink constitutes of millions of microcapsules having a transparent outer shell. Inside are tiny white pigment chips that float in a blue coloured dye. These white spheres carry a positive charge. The e-ink with millions of such microcapsules are placed between two electrodes. When the top electrode layer is negatively charged, it draws the positively charged white coloured pigment chips towards the top, reading surface, making them shine and stand out against the background of the blue dye. And, Loila! the letters and images become legible. A similar charge in the lower layer pulls the white pigments down, making them invisible to the eye. A combination of such white pigment chips on the surface make the words and images visible. These characters can easily be changed any time by altering with the charge on the electrode layers, which is manipulated through the wireless signals. The e-ink is already in use on display boards at several US supermarkets, airports, ATMs and offices.</li>
<li>The commercial advantages include its thinness, low weight and power efficiency (0.1 watts). The system is networkable through wireless and wired systems and is also mobile (if supported by wireless system). Thus, the displays can be controlled from one central location. Need a publisher or,a reader ask for anything more? (For more details access the official site, www.eink.com).</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Many have labelled the prevailing drought situation as a man-made disaster. Towns and villages over large parts of the country are desperate for water. Many are dependent on periodic tanker supplies ferried across considerable distances. As summer advances, communities may be compelled to migrate unless help comes their way.</li>
<li>Rainfall is often erratic and unevenly distributed over space and time. Many regions regularly experience recurrent drought and/or flood as part of their normal hydrological cycle. Droughts, like floods, are therefore no surprise. It can be mitigated, even averted, by drought-proofing and, like flood, must be appropriately managed as and when it occurs.</li>
<li>Population growth and development aimed at enhancing the quality of life entails larger water use. This is subjecting India to increase seasonal and regional water stress, with deteriorating water quality being an aggravating factor. Water conservation at all times and places, improved water management and maintaining water quality are therefore critical.</li>
<li>These measures are not necessarily mutually exclusive and each has certain costs and benefits. The objective should be to secure optimality. The notion that rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge and sound water management by themselves can provide a complete or sufficient answer to India's water needs is mistaken. Pursued as a panacea that obviates the need for large dams, it could rob the country of vital insurance against disaster.</li>
<li>It is wholly fallacious to argue that if hundreds of large dams (over 15 metres high) have not averted the drought this year, the hugely demonised Sardar Sarovar, for instance, will make no difference. The simple answer is that the hundreds of dams and storages on local rain-fed rivers and smaller conservation works and traditional systems must fail if the rains fail. Deserted villages are mute testimony to this truth.</li>
<li>Sufficient rain must first fall before it can be harvested in situ. North Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch suffer aridity. But the Narmada rises over 1300 kilometres away in a relatively high rainfall region. If its abundant flood waters are stored, these can be diverted from the terminal Sardar Sarovar dam to the very areas of Gujarat most troubled by drought. Gujarat's allotted share of nine million acre feet of water-or even half that quantum- would have averted much of the present distress had the dam height reached 110 metres when the canals would begin to flow and generate energy.</li>
<li>The distribution system is far advanced and would have guaranteed drinking water, fodder and livelihood to millions. It would have recharged groundwater and filled hundreds of village ponds and depressions en route.</li>
<li>Dams are not a unique or absolute solution. But it is a dangerous mantra that small is beautiful, big is bad. The two go together. What would northwest India, indeed all of India, be minus the Bhakra-Pong? The country has a huge task ahead to manage its water resources sensibly, optimally and equitably. This is what the nation must address unitedly without losing more time in futile, wholly unproductive arguments. The present drought is both a crisis and an opportunity. Which shall it be?</li>

<p><strong>2.2</strong> Drought is manmade disaster. Towns and villages disperate of water get periodic taker supply. In summer in lack of sufficient supply people have to migrate. Drought cause due to uneven rainfall, large use of water by large population. To overcome drought water conservation, water management, rain water harvesting and recharging of the ground water should be promoted. Hundreds of dams and storage on local rain fed rivers and small traditional manners can also reduce the problem of water drought.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>The world today is confronted with a large number of problems like arms proliferation, fundamentalism, separatist movements as well as international terrorism. International terrorism has today emerged as one of the most ominous threats to world peace and security. There has been considerable growth of terrorism between the 1960s and 1980s. This has largely been due to the characteristics of the international system. The most important of these are deep and bitter ethnic, religious and ideological conflicts which remain unresolved and which fester in the international system, spawning many forms of violent conflicts, terrorism and periodically erupting into civil and international wars.</li>
<li>Another underlying factor for the growth of terrorism is the use of unconventional and proxy war methods. Here terrorism becomes an attractive instrument of policy for states and sub-state organisations such as national liberation movements. Such methods are low-cost, relatively low-risk and yet afford the possibility of high yields.</li>
<li>The worldwide dissemination of new technology has also facilitated the growth of terrorism. For example, the development of international civil aviation has created new vulnerabilities and lucrative targets for terrorists to exploit. Modern weapon technology has also proved to be a boon to terrorists.</li>
<li>Terrorism today has taken different forms. These include political terrorism involving not only the use of terrorism by the state but also against the state, religious terrorism, micro terrorism as well as the recent emergence of nuclear terrorism.</li>
<li>The legitimacy of terrorism depends on various factors. Perceptions vary. The greatest justification which a terrorist finds is in a struggle between two adversaries: it is not the means but the end which is important. The United Nations Human Rights Commission has recognised that terrorism can destroy human rights and fundamental freedom of the people and threatens the territorial integrity of nations.</li>
<li>One of the most basic rights of every individual is the right to life. Terrorism, which basically involves violence and killing thus takes away this right from individuals. Besides, the use of violence for achieving a goal, no matter how justified it is the same cannot be approved.</li>
<li>Terrorism also poses a law and order problem for the state while at the same time the economy suffers as a result of damage to trade, valuable resources as well as scaring away of investors. It is thus imperative to look for some mechanism to check the problem of international terrorism. Although there exists a large number of treaties including extradition treaties, they have not been able to check terrorism. This has happened due to the failure of states to comply with the provision of the treaties.</li>

Basically terrorism has taken different forms like political, religious, microterrorism and nuclear terrorism. Terrorism is struggle between two adversaries as it destroy human rights and freedom of people. So it must be eradicated to protect integrity of nations.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Out of the staggering amount of money that the state and central government spend on higher education, fifty per cent is wasted due to fifty per cent failures in the university examinations all over the country. There is a single strong reason why a university degree should be paid for in full by the student himself.</li>
<li>This thinking has been gathering momentum since January 1986, when the pay scales of college and university teachers were revised and which put an additional burden of more than a hundred crores on the University Grants Commission and the state governments. Arrears to the tune of ₹ 5,000 to ₹ 22,000 were given to all teachers in most of the 150 universities and 5,000 colleges of the country. Because of the enhanced salary and dearness allowance, which is revised every January and July, the government expenditure on higher education has almost doubled during the last five years.</li>
<li>As against this, the tuition fees have remained static since Independence (with minimal revisions last year). Not that the governments did not consider the question of raising them, but the threat of student agitation and political unpopularity proved a hurdle too strong to surmount. Consequently, there is now a yawning gap between what a college student pays and what the state spends on him.</li>
<li>According to UGC sources, a student pays rupees 200, 250 and 325 per annum for education in arts, commerce and science respectively, whereas the government subsidy amounts to Rupees 2800, 3400 and 4200 annually. This includes the expenditure incurred by some trust managed colleges which, according to the rules of the states in which they function, comes to 5 per cent to 3 per cent. But as most of the colleges have found ways to evade even this responsibility, the ultimate burden falls on the governments themselves.</li>
<li>A way out of the imbroglio was thought out in recent years. The Human Resources Development Ministry floated the concept of autonomous colleges. After much public debate it was decided that some hundred colleges should be granted autonomy to begin with. Now about 90 colleges are autonomous. They are making appointments, framing their own syllabi and conducting examinations, but have not yet been able to muster up courage to enhance fees. They continue to eive maintenance grants from the state coffers.</li>
<li>Under the circumstances, the concept of self-financing higher education seems to be a remote dream. Secondly, as most of the university campuses are politically alive and financially bankrupt, the government will have to continue paying them their annual grants. Suddenly, converting them into self-financing institutions has become impossible. It is a different matter if the states start a new set of educational institutions as totally self-financed. But who will bear the huge initial expenditure-the parents or the government?</li>

<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Passage 16:</strong></span></p>
qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>There are so many things we humans tend to hold back on. We repress a lot of our emotions, whether they are considered 'good' or "had' ones.</li>
<li>Sometimes we hold back on expressing our love for fear of being misunderstood, or perhaps thinking the timing is not 'right'. Most commonly, we have been taught to hold back on our 'negative' emotions fear, anger, sorrow, pain, etc.</li>
<li>As a child, I was often told to squelch those emotions that demonstrated 'weakness'. I held back my tears in order to appear strong. I repressed my anger to be a 'good girl' and 'loving'.</li>
<li>Yet, I now realize that holding back anger or any other emotion affects negatively the person who is holding back. The anger I refused to let out stayed locked up inside, fermented, and gave rise to all kinds of poison. Frustrations and anger were withheld, only to explode when I'd 'had enough'. This anger later had to be released through illness, situations where the anger was unleashed at someone or something else (or at myself), or through therapy.</li>
<li>What happens when you feel anger (consciously or sub-consciously) but want to hide it? Whatever we hold back becomes a part of us and gets stored in our body as a tangible manifestation in the form of headaches, tension, pain, illness, ulcers, cancer, arthritis, back pain, and many other physical ailments.</li>
<li>Of course, we feel that by holding back on expressing our anger we are doing the 'right' thing and not hurting anyone. Yet, little do we know, the other person may need to hear what we have to say, just as much as we need to express it.</li>
<li>Of course, we need to learn how to express our anger or discontent without 'dumping' on the other. We can express ourselves without destroying the other person's sense of self-worth or attacking them emotionally, verbally, or physically.</li>
<li>Expressing our deepest feelings also applies to expressing feelings of love and appreciation. How many times have we felt gratefulness towards another being, sometimes just for their presence in our life, and failed to express it? That person may really need to hear your words of praise to give them a boost in their own self-esteem. May be they are unaware of what you so clearly see in them.</li>
<li>I have found that at times when I expressed feelings of gratitude and love to others, they were surprised at the way I saw them. Never assume that the other person knows how much you appreciate them. If you think it and feel it, then say it.</li>
<li>Our rational mind has been well trained to dissect and analyse. It likes to hold back on acting instinctively and instead question scientifically what is the 'right' action to take. So, we've held our true selves back, and not expressed that inner inspiration to laugh, cry, scream, give a hug, or say a kind word when our first feeling guided us to do so.</li>
<li>Whatever first thought or feeling comes to you is your intuition, or in other words, your divine inspiration. Any other thoughts that follow, i.e. "may be I shouldn't say that", etc., are only your mind (ego) doubting and questioning, afraid of making a 'mistake'.</li>
<li>The best thing to do is to follow your first instinct, your inner guidance, which comes as the first feeling or thought. That is your 'God-self.' The universal power of Love guides us towards happiness, and that is why our first instinct is always the one that will bring us true happiness and inner peace.</li>
<li>We can choose to let go of the fear of being wrong, or appearing ridiculous, etc., and act on our feelings. Be true to yourself. Holding back is only postponing the truth and can harm the other as well as ourselves. Holding back is postponing the freedom to be who we really are loving, truthful children who desire to be happy and free from negativity.</li>
<li>Let go! Express your truth today! You and your world will be better for it.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Had it not been for an alert and environmentally conscious judiciary, chances are that we would have literally been wallowing in our own filth. Once again, the Supreme Court has intervened decisively to prevent the further degradation of the Yamuna by asking industries discharging effluents into the river to install treatment plants by November 1 or face closure. The river, once Delhi's lifeline, is now 'dead' for a stretch of around 32 km around the Capital. The courts have been forced into this sort of judicial activism time and again in the face of blatant violations of environmental norms both by industries and citizens. Over the last few years, the courts have facilitated the introduction of lead- free petrol, ordered the phasing out of automobiles which are over 15 years old and made pollution checks for all vehicles mandatory. The apex court has been relentless in its opposition to any move which affects the environment adversely. From banning polythene bags in cities to censuring polluting shrimp farms in Tamil Nadu and chemical units in Rajasthan, it has always upheld the principle that pollution prevention is better than control. The courts have laid down rigorous standards for industries right from the inception stage. Indian industry has been particularly indifferent to preserving the environment and the health of those in and around industrial units.</li>
<li>The Central Pollution Control Board has come up with a number of positive suggestions on enforcing the green agenda. But the response from industries has been tardy. One was a scheme which sought to pool the resources of industrial units so as to fund a common effluent treatment plant. But, industries find it more convenient to discharge their waste any which way, endangering the lives of those in the vicinity and degrading common resources like land and water. Proposals to levy commercial rates on water supply to industries have been overlooked so far, leaving industries with little incentive to treat and reuse water. Now the government itself has agreed to foot part of the cost to set up effluent treatment plants in the hope that this will motivate industry to take action. The common refrain that the technology required for waste management is expensive is valid, but industries have to realise that they cannot indulge in poisonous practices in the pursuit of profit to the detriment of the greater common good. It is this attitude that the polluter will not pay that has led the courts to step in. An example of the efficacy of judicial activism is the manner in which Agra has been rid of highly polluting industries which were destroying the fabled Taj. The Indian experience has shown that when faced with censure, industries prefer to shut shop rather than invest in clean technology. Many do so in order to cash in on burgeoning real estate prices as in the Bombay mills story. In this context, the courts' insistence that environmental norms be built into project proposals is commendable. Denying permission to set up shop is hitting industry where it hurts the most. This will, in the long run, force it to stop taking the green agenda quite so lightly.</li>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>Shop till you drop is no longer a problem that only women with money in their purses and time on their hands suffer from. Excessive shopping and insatiable appetite for goods are causing problems in all countries which have hitherto promoted naked<br />
consumerism because personal debts are mounting, creating innumerable difficulties for credit card businesses. Millions are gripped by an insatiable appetite to spend and visit the frequent sales that keep occurring in New York, Milan, London or Paris. People can become compulsive buyers of anything from household gadgets, food, clothes, to cars.</li>
<li>Compulsive buying has now been diagnosed as a disease and is the result of the growing advertising campaigns and competition in which shops and firms undercut each other with huge price discounts. If shops are closed and it is too late, there is always the possibility of shopping through the net. The addiction to shopping is spreading all over the world. In UK, 2.5 million people are gripped by the shopping fever. In America, a shopper's paradise, the number is much more at 15 million. With rising incomes, millions of Indians could join the league of 'shopoholics'. It is called 'oniomania' which is a compulsive disorder that drives people to buy in a repetitive and uncontrolled manner regardless of consequences.</li>
<li>Self-help groups are springing up to help compulsive shoppers. Because people affected by this problem suffer greatly from feelings of isolation, guilt and fear. It can lead to a break down of relationships under the burden of debt and deceit. Women are more vulnerable than men to this addiction because they tend to believe that to be valued by society they have to look good. They are more insecure about their image and while they are shopping, they get a boost to their self image from the attention they get from shop assistants. They come back feeling beautiful and successful. Men too are now joining the ranks of keen shoppers.</li>
<li>The results can be devastating and debts can be huge. Compulsive shoppers keep borrowing on their credit cards. Psychologists are now saying that people have to face compulsive shopping as a disorder. It is like the eating disorder or work or exercise addiction. Most people with eating disorders also have shopping/spending problems. To break the habit various tips are now being offered and one of the important tips is not to look at glossy magazines. Most of these magazines work on people's aspirations and make the readers discontented with their lifestyle and prompt them to buy more. Other tips include taking regular stock of one's clothes and accessories and piling them up in heaps to convince oneself that one doesn't need more.</li>
<li>Other ways to discourage shoppers is to make credit less easily available. Advertising that encourages consumers to borrow and buy instantly are also encouraging shopoholics. Easy credit to the young is one way of encouraging them to shop without guilt and thus more careful screening of potential card holders is necessary to ward off future bad debts. But unfortunately, these deterrents may not work because like the children of alcoholics and drug addicts turn to these substances, children of shoppers also indulge in compulsive shopping.</li>

<li>Ever since the first genetic sequence was elucidated in the 70s, biotechnology has fast evolved into an information science. Scientists have already compiled the three gigabytes that spell out the human genetic code-a quantity of information that might fill more than 2,000 standard computer diskettes. But that's just the initial trickle of a flood of knowledge to be tapped from the Human Genome Project. Considering that the project aims to identify all the estimated 80,000 genes in human DNA, the sequences of its three billion chemical bases will definitely be deciphered by the end of 2005. And once these genes are known, the data available will be mammoth, as scientists try to understand how these genes impact health and diseases.</li>
<li>"At that point," asserts Dr Philip Campbell, Editor-in-Chief, Nature, "a marriage between biology and computer science will become increasingly crucial within the peripheries of the biotech industry." In fact, according to a CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) study, the challenge of processing complex colossal data has already spawned a hot global industry called bioinformatics, poised to touch $ 60 billion by 2005. Major players all over the globe have, as a result, formed bioinformatics groups, thereby creating a boom in job opportunities.</li>
<li>Those in bioinformatics need to perform two critical roles: develop IT tools embodying novel algorithms and analytical techniques, or apply existing tools to achieve new insights into molecular biology. There are, however, other opportunities as well. Jobs range from testing, documentation, running operating procedures and database administration to programming, software development, algorithm creation and scientific visualisation.</li>
<li>One needs to be either a biologist with a certain degree of computer knowledge or a computer professional with a serious interest in biology. For increased career opportunities, possessing both skill-sets is a good idea though employers usually desire a knowledge in computer applications. Companies need people at all levels. M.Sc., M.Tech., and Ph.Ds. In fact, a number of professionals do advanced diploma courses in bioinformatics, though the most sought-after candidates are those who have done a Masters degree.</li>
<li>Professionals trained in bioinformatics can expect to earn salaries upwards of ₹ 2,00,000 per annum. A key indicator of the popularity of the field is the placement of students. For instance, students from the University of Pune have been lapped up by various Indian and multinational biotech and pharmaceutical companies. With experience, professionals can expect to earn anything between ₹ 30,000-75,000 per month.</li>
<li>In fact, industry watchers feel that since the earning potential in the West is much higher, most scientists and professionals from premier research organisations leave for greener pastures, forcing Indian research institutes to go on recruitment drives.</li>
<li>"We should make job positions in India much more lucrative," says Prof. P.C. Trivedi, Head, Biotechnology Department, Maharaja's College, Jaipur. This is more so because there is going to be a huge demand for top class database management. As creating a database is an expensive proposition in the West, Indian IT companies have a cost- advantage when it comes to offering complete database solutions to pharmaceutical and genome-based biotech companies worldwide. Says Prof. Raka Kamal, Principal, Maharani's College, Jaipur, "Because of its strength in the fields of mathematics, IT, physics and chemistry, the nation is ideally positioned to emerge as a front-runner in biotech and bioinformatics." What we need is investment, bandwidth and integrated databases. With these in place, India is set to go to the top in this particular race.</li>

<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Passage 20:</strong></span></p>
qproRead the following passages carefully:<br />
<ol>
<li>While there is no dearth of activists shouting themselves hoarse about skyrocketing air and water pollution levels in the Capital, it is unfortunate that the equally escalating and medically injurious noise pollution level is totally ignored. With Diwali round the corner, many are resigned to suffering the bone-jarring explosions of firecrackers, not to mention the pollutants they emit.</li>
<li>Well, it seems everyone is getting into the act. The Department of Environment has carried out campaigns in 150 schools this year to educate children about the harmful effects of bursting crackers on the eardrums and the lungs. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has already initiated its campaign entitled "Say no to crackers, join the anti-cracker campaign." NGOs like Pravaha and Pandies Theatre along with the DPCC have organised meetings and plays to get the message across. Last year, the stipulation on restricting cracker burning from 6.00 pm to 11.00 pm on Diwali went a long way in curbing noise levels. The Delhi Government is also requesting people this year to keep away from streets and parking lots within residential colonies and to burst crackers in open spaces and parks. Infants and pregnant women are more vulnerable to the ill-effects of noise pollution.</li>
<li>But by and large, the problem of noise pollution remains ignored. Despite warnings from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) the decibel levels on the street are way above safe levels &#8211; even in the silence zones. While traffic congestion and increasing population are the main culprits, lack of public awareness and civic sense compounds the problem. The CPCB standards have fixed the daytime noise limits to 55 dB in a residential colony and 45 dB for night. Almost all Delhi colonies are well over these marks. The health and behaviour patterns of those exposed to high noise levels above 55 dB changes. Aggressive behaviour and sleep disturbance along with annoyance and irritability become marked. Regular exposure to 65 dB can lead to hypertension. Anything above 75 dB can cause extreme stress, increasing heart rates and potential hearing loss. In infants, noise pollution can cause speech disorder and decreased learning ability. The medical fraternity maintains that 2 per cent of the Indian population has a hearing problem, the percentage being even greater in metros and industrial townships.</li>
<li>In Delhi vehicular traffic, three wheelers, trucks and motorcycles with silencers chopped off contribute the most to noise pollution levels. Then there are the zillion generators in residential, commercial and industrial locations. The Delhi High Court had, in August this year, directed the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to notify the emission norms for portable generators and asked the CPCB to finalise noise standards. Meanwhile the National Committee on Noise Pollution Control (NCNPC) recommended reduction of 5 to 15 dB in the noise levels for gensets up to 2.5 KVA. Unfortunately nothing has been done on this front and gensets of all shapes and sizes continue to drone.</li>
<li>A gazette notification from the NCNPC will soon make it mandatory for manufacturers to display how noisy each domestic gadget is. According to a study, mixer grinders, which can be heard churning a block away, are also a major source of noise pollution in residential colonies, apart from coolers and gensets. The Delhi Ridge and the Zoo are the major sufferers. The high noise levels in the arterial roads around the Zoo along with the noise caused by movement of trains makes the animals irritable and in some cases has also affected the mating pattern. The silence zones, particularly schools and hospitals, have also been badly hit. In fact, sometimes the biggest culprits are the police-at the busy AIIMS intersection, they use loudspeakers to control traffic and pedestrian movement. Yes, there is no dearth of laws and regulations to curb the noise menace but it's the implementation that remains tardy. Air horns and loudspeakers are banned in public, but who cares.</li>

<p><strong>2.2</strong> Noise pollution should not be ignored. It is escalating and medically injurious. Near Diwali noise of crackers may harm ear drums and lungs by noise and emitted pollutants. Except it sound above 55 dB results in aggressive behaviour, sleep disturbance, annoyance and irritability. While upto 65 dB cause hypertension and above 75 dB leads to extreme stress, increasing heart rate and potential hearing loss. To check noise pollution many laws and regulations have been made but their implementation remains tardy.</p>

<p>Letters are written communications. Writing letters is an art and it is mastered through practice. The importance of letter writing cannot be over emphasised. Letters develop social discourse, strengthen business relations and win over the officers and employers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>KINDS OF LETTERS</strong></span><br />
Letter-writing can be divided into two main kinds:<br />
(a) Formal Letters<br />
(b) Informal Letters<br />
<strong>Formal Letters</strong> include business letters, applications for jobs, letters to editors, letters to Principal/Officers and letters of complaints to authorities.<br />
<strong>Informal Letters</strong> are written to friends, relatives, acquaintances and teachers. These include private and personal matters such as condolences, congratulations, invitations, etc. Note. The syllabus specifies the following letter types:<br />
(a) Letters to Editors<br />
(b) Letters to School or college authorities<br />
Since both these types are Formal Letters, we shall concentrate only on these two types of Formal Letters.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>STRUCTURE OF A FORMAL LETTER</strong></span><br />
A formal letter has seven parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Address of the sender including the Date</li>
<li>The Inside Address</li>
<li>The Salutation</li>
<li>Subject Heading</li>
<li>The Body of the Letter</li>
<li>The Subscription</li>
<li>The Signature</li>
</ol>
<p>Each part begins on the left hand side margin. The block format is used and there is no indentation. One line may be left to indicate the beginning of a new part/paragraph.<br />
<strong>1. (a) The Address of the Sender.</strong> The complete address of the sender is written on the top of the page, preferably on the left side, without punctuation marks, e.g.,<br />
237 Jyoti Apartments<br />
Ashok Vihar<br />
New Delhi-110048<br />
<strong>(b) The Date</strong> is written just below the Sender's Address. In formal letters dates can be written as under:</p>
<ol>
<li>10 July 2011 or</li>
<li>July 10, 2011</li>
</ol>
<p>The former is the British style while the latter is the American style. In our country mostly people follow the British style, but these days some people have started using the American style. Students should avoid writing dates as 10.7.11 or 10/7/11 as it may be understood as October 7, 2011 or 10 July, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>The Inside Address.</strong> The inside address is written below the date line after leaving some space, e.g.,<br />
M/s Kapoor Brothers<br />
Paper Merchants<br />
Chawri Bazar<br />
Delhi-110006<br />
However, the word M/s (Messers) should not be used:</p>
<ol>
<li>before the name of firms trading under an impersonal name, such as 'The Golden Carriers', 'The Karnataka Small Scale Industries'.</li>
<li>before the name of firms beginning with a singular proper noun, such as Gupta Sales Corporation, Anil Hardware Stores, etc.</li>
<li>before the names of limited companies, such as Hindustan National Glass Ltd., etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. The Salutation or Greeting.</strong> The writer uses appropriate words for the receiver according to his/her relation. The salutation comes just below the address of the recipient. Its first and last word should be written with a capital letter. A comma (,) may be put after the salutation, e.g.,</p>
<ol>
<li>In Business Letters we write<br />
Dear Sir,    Dear Sirs,</li>
<li>In official letters, applications or letters to the Editors we write<br />
Sir/Dear, Sir/Respected Sir or Madam/Dear Madam,</li>
</ol>
<p>Dear Sir/Sirs is used while addressing a firm. Dear Sir/Dear Madam is used while addressing some single official.</p>
<p><strong>4. Subject Heading.</strong> Mention the heading of the subject below the salutation in the middle. The subject should be mentioned briefly. This helps in speedy compliance/ disposal.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Body of the Letter.</strong> It is the most important part of the letter. It contains the actual message to be conveyed. It may be broken into various paragraphs, each paragraph dealing with only one idea. Begin with a new paragraph each time you say something new. A formal letter must have at least three paragraphs in the body of the letter</p>
<ol>
<li>Introductory para,</li>
<li>Main body of the letter and</li>
<li>The concluding para.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6. The Subscription.</strong> It is also called the complimentary close. It is simply a polite way of leave taking. It should agree in style and tone with the salutation. If you have used 'Sir/Madam' in your salutation, the subscription is Tours faithfully'. However, if the person addressed is known to the writer and is addressed as Dear Sir/Madam, Tours sincerely1 may be used.<br />
Note:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not write 'Tours truly", as it is no longer accepted. 'Tours" doesn't have an apostrophe. And remember, "Thanking you" is grammatically wrong and should not be used.</li>
<li>Beginning with "To" and ending a letter with "from" is now considered obsolete.</li>
<li>The format of a letter is on the left side.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7. The Signature.</strong> The signature is put below the subscription. In formal letters, the name and designation should follow the signature.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>SOME OPTIONAL PARTS</strong></span><br />
<strong>(a) Reference Number</strong> (Ref No.) It appears between the writer's address and date. Here you may give file No., letter No. and number and dates or particulars of previous correspondence etc.<br />
<strong>(b) Enclosures</strong> (Enel). A mention of the enclosed papers and documents, if attached separately, is made on the left hand side below the signature.<br />
<strong>(c) Copies</strong> (c.c). In case it is necessary to send a copy of the letter to a third person, this is indicated by (c.c.) followed by the name and address. It appears below the enclosures. In order to write good Business/Official letters follow the following guidelines:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>GUIDELINES</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Writing Good Business/Official Letters</strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Be brief, clear, concise and to the point.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Use a proper layout/format for these formal letters. The layout may be in block format or indented format (as in informal letters).<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Use of punctuation marks is adopted in the indented form but it is dispensed with in the block format.<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Do not mix the two formats. It would be better for you to practise and follow the block format which is in vogue after introduction of computers.<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Convey facts briefly but impressively. Indicate the theme in the initial para of the body of the letter. Develop your points in the middle paragraph and conclude/give suggestions in the final part of the body of the letter.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Use simple and direct language. Avoid the use of long and high sounding words and ambiguous constructions.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Be courteous. Even while lodging a complaint or criticising, you should be polite and charming.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Remember the following points about block format:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no indentation.</li>
<li>Each block begins with the margin on left hand side.</li>
<li>Extra space should be left between different sections and paragraphs.</li>
<li>Omit punctuation marks in address, date or salutation. In case you put a comma in the address, use it throughout. Do not mix the two systems.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Marks for Letter-writing are awarded as under:<br />
Format &#8211; 2, content &#8211; 3, Expression &#8211; 2, Letter question is of 7 marks.<br />
However, no marks are given for format alone if there is no content.</p>
<p><strong>10. Golden Rule:</strong> Always use<br />
(a) suitable format<br />
(b) well-organised content<br />
(c) appropriate language<br />
Study the formats given below, observe their use in solved examples and adopt them in the exercises given for practice:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>(ii) CONTENT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The content of the letter must be well-organised to ensure clarity and effective communication. The content is divided into three main parts. The introductory paragraph introduces the theme. The main part deals with the problem. It is the real content of the letter. The closing part of the body gives conclusion or offers suggestion.<br />
Be brief and to the point. Mention specific business issues only. The tone should be polite but formal.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>1. BUSINESS LETTERS</strong></span></p>
<p>A business letter is different from a personal letter in form, tone and content. In personal letters we may follow an informal, friendly or personal tone, content or style. But business letters demand a formal and matter of fact treatment. These letters are generally written to or by commercial and business firms and enterprises, so they must be simple and systematic, brief and specific in content and formal in treatment of the subject.<br />
Commercial correspondence occupies an important role in the modem world of commerce, trade and industry. So students are advised to master the art and craft of writing good business letters.<br />
<strong>WRITING GOOD BUSINESS LETTERS</strong><br />
<strong>1.</strong> Be brief, clear and to the point.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Use separate paragraphs for separate topics.<br />
<strong>3.</strong> The first para should indicate the theme of the letter.<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Make a factual statement of facts.<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Use simple and direct language. Avoid the use of long and high sounding words and ambiguous construction.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Even while lodging a complaint or making criticism, you should be polite and charming.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Avoid common-place and clumsy expressions.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Use a proper layout / format for these formal letters. The block format is more in vogue in formal letters whereas the indented format may be used in informal letters.<br />
<strong>9.</strong> Use of punctuation marks is dispensed with in the block format.<br />
<strong>10.</strong> Remember the following points about block format :</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no indentation.</li>
<li>Each block begins with the margin on Left Hand Side.</li>
<li>Extra space should be left between different sections and paragraphs.</li>
<li>Omit punctuation marks in address and date. A comma (,) may be put after the salutation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Golden Rule.</strong> Always use:<br />
(a) Suitable format.<br />
(b) Well-organised content.<br />
(c) Appropriate language.</p>

<p><strong>Marks for Letter Writing are awarded on the following lines:</strong></p>
<p>Format : 2 Marks<br />
Content : 4 Marks<br />
Expression : 4 Marks</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>FORMAT/LAYOUT</strong></span><br />
Upto 2 marks may be deducted for not using proper layout. Layout should include date, receiver's designation and address, salutation, subject, complimentary close and designation of writer.<br />
However, no marks are awarded for format alone if there is no content or if the content is wrong.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>CONTENT</strong></span><br />
It includes your creativity in presenting ideas which are relevant to the topic of the letter. The content of the letter must be well-organised to ensure clarity and effective communication. The content is divided into three main parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introductory part</li>
<li>Main part</li>
<li>Concluding remarks
<ul>
<li>The introductory paragraph introduces the theme.</li>
<li>The main part deals with the problem/issue. It is the real content of the letter.</li>
<li>The closing part of the body gives conclusions or offers suggestions.<br />
<strong>Some Tips:</strong><br />
- Be brief and to the point<br />
- Mention specific issues only<br />
- Tone : polite but formal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In letters to editors state the problem clearly. Try to present both sides of the picture. In case of a discursive topic or one requiring argumentative presentation, give the pros and cons of the situation. Always offer useful suggestions to overcome the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>EXPRESSION</strong></span><br />
<strong>(a) Fluency</strong> is your ability to present your ideas in a coherent and organised way. Before answering in the 'fair', you must prepare a rough draft and jot down your ideas. You may follow the process detailed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about the letter/topic.</li>
<li>Collect all the ideas and put them down roughly.</li>
<li>Organise the ideas by putting common ideas together.</li>
<li>Arrange them sequentially.</li>
<li>End on a positive note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Accuracy</strong> involves grammatical correctness as well as structuring of sentences. Your effort should not be to use complex, long and unwieldy sentences, but to present your content in simple, straightforward language.<br />
<strong>Note the following points about the use of language:</strong><br />
<strong>(a) Business/Official Letters :  </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>simple and direct</li>
<li>formal tone</li>
<li>straightforward manner</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(b) Letters to Editors :    </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>greater flexibility</li>
<li>suitable to subject/content</li>
<li>formal, direct and pointed</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note. </strong>I have the honour to state&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..<br />
is obsolete and is no longer used.<br />
It is easier and simple to say-<br />
I wish to say&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;/ I want to say&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;<br />
Study the general layout of the formal letters carefully. We are talking of the block format which has no indentation or punctuation. Each paragraph/point begins on the left hand side margin. There is gap after each block.</p>
<p><strong>1. Sender's Address.</strong> Top left-hand comer. Omit punctuation marks.<br />
<strong>2. The Date.</strong> Just below the Sender's address. These days marks of punctuation are not used. You may write</p>
<ol>
<li>17 March 20XX</li>
<li>March 17, 20XX</li>
<li>17th March 20XX.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>3. Inside Address.</strong> The Name and Designation of the addressee is written on the left hand side, two lines below the line of date.<br />
<strong>4. The Salutation.</strong> On the left hand side below the 'Inside Address'. The usual form of salutation is 'Sir' or 'Dear Sir' for individuals, 'Sirs' or 'Dear Sirs' for firms or companies. In America, they write 'gentlemen' instead of Dear Sirs'. Use 'Madam' while addressing a lady.<br />
In case the addressee is personally known to the writer, names are also used as :<br />
Dear Mr Gupta<br />
Dear Miss Sapna<br />
Dear Mrs. Sood<br />
<strong>5. Subject.</strong> The subject heading is written just below the salutation and above the 'Body of the Letter'. It helps in quick disposal of the letter.<br />
<strong>6. The Body/Content of the Letter.</strong> This is the most important part of the letter. Mention specific business only. Fluency and accuracy in presentation of well organised relevant ideas is essential.<br />
<strong>7. The Complimentary Close.</strong> Written on the left hand side a couple of lines below the last line of the body of the letter. The usual complimentary endings are :</p>
<ol>
<li>yours faithfully</li>
<li>yours truly</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if the name of a person is used in the salutation, the complimentary close can be 'yours sincerely'.</p>
<p><strong>8. Signature.</strong> A formal letter requires your lull signature with the name and designation coming just below it. The 'signature' is put just below the complimentary close.</p>

Dear Priyanka<br />
Received your affectionate letter and was glad to note that you are going to complete X standard. I felt elated when you sought my advise whether to opt for science or commerce group in XI standard.<br />
In my opinion, you should not join the rat race of choosing the science stream. I know that you are a practical person, who is intelligent as well as diligent. I would therefore suggest that you should opt for commerce group. There are some other reasons behind this choice,</p>
<ol>
<li>Your father is a successful businessman. As a student of commerce you may learn business/management in practice. Secondly, he may set up a small unit for you and invest in it. You can manage and expand it with your knowledge of commerce and English.</li>
<li>In case you want to seek employment, your commerce degree may help you get a good job in some multinational firm.</li>
<li>You may appear in a competitive examination for bank recruitment etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do hope you will consider all these points before arriving at any decision.<br />
With love.<br />

Sir,<br />
I bought a Cordless Electric Iron from you on 27 January, 20XX vide receipt no. 6578. I had bought it with a view to making my task easier. Unfortunately it has become even more complicated now. When it is taken off the mains, the heat in the iron lasts for hardly a few seconds. Sometimes it does not show any signs of heat even after inserting in the main switch. It seems that it has ceased functioning. You can just imagine the irritation it causes by not working when needed most. It is only in an emergency that I iron my clothes myself and at such moments this cordless iron stops functioning. Thus the piece has become a headache as it is an unreliable nuisance. Since there is a warranty of 2 years with this Iron, I earnestly request you to replace this defective piece with another one.<br />

<strong>Sub :</strong> Arrangements to Store Rain Water<br />
Sir,<br />
The residents of Vasant Vihar have faced an acute shortage of water during summer season. This year was exceptionally hot and a lot of water was needed for quenching thirst, bathing, cooking and other basic household needs like washing clothes, utensils etc. The shortage of water caused a lot of problems and turned people's life to a virtual hell.<br />
The rainy season is at hand. You are requested to make arrangements to store rain water and utilise it during the lean periods of water supply. Moreover, awareness should be created among the people, by distributing pamphlets, advertisements in<br />
newspaper, T.V. etc. to save water. Practical demonstrations of 'Rain Harvesting1 will prove an educative step. Posters on Water is Precious' and 'Water is Life' may be displayed at important places.<br />
I hope my suggestions will find favour with you.<br />

<strong>Sub :</strong> Poor sanitary conditions and mosquito menace in Periyar Road<br />
Sir,<br />
I want to draw your kind attention towards the poor sanitary conditions prevailing in our locality &#8211; Periyar Road. It seems that the cleaners have forgotten the existence of this locality on the civic map of Chennai. Heaps of rubbish are lying here and there, with flies swarming around and pigs wallowing in the filth and mud caused by the overflow of dirty water from the drains on to the road. The drains are choked as they are neither cleaned nor flushed.<br />
The dirty water collects on the road forming cesspools of filthy water. There are also many pits on the roads which are full of drain water. All these serve as breeding places for mosquitoes. The mosquito menace is so intense in our locality that we have to use anti mosquito sprays, mats and aerosols to have undisturbed sleep for a couple of hours. You are requested to pay a surprise visit to the locality and judge the state yourself. Kindly take some immediate and effective steps to improve the sanitation and rid us from the menace of mosquitoes.<br />
Hoping for a favourable action.<br />

Bangalore<br />
Sub : Inadequate Parking Facilities<br />
Sir,<br />
I wish to draw your attention towards the lack of an essential civic amenity which causes trouble not only to the vehicle users but also to the general public. The inadequate parking facilities in the commercial street area of Bangalore has caused a sea of chaos, confusion and disorder. Most of the vehicles are parked on roads blocking the passages to and from the parking spaces. The problem gets worse during the evening hours. People are stranded as they can't park their vehicles at places earmarked for parking. Nor can they move out easily towards the road from the parking spaces.<br />
I would like to offer some practical suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vehicles with even number should be allowed on even days i.e. (Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) while those with odd ones be used on odd days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). This will cut the number of vehicles by 50%.</li>
<li>The parking lots should be controlled by the police so that entry/exit is not blocked. I hope my suggestions will be</li>
</ol>
<p>implemented for public benefit.<br />
Thanking you.<br />

<strong>Sub :</strong> Eve-teasing and Crimes against Women<br />
Sir,<br />
The anti-social elements are having a field day in our area. Minor incidents of stealing, pick-pocketing and robberies have become a part and parcel of civic life. What has shocked the sensibility of the youth is the ever increasing trend in disrespect towards women in general and young girls in particular.<br />
Clusters of young boys can be seen standing in groups at public places like bus-stops, street-comers, park entrances etc. When a young girl or a couple of girls happen to pass near them, they invariably subject them to verbal abuse, filthy remarks and obscene gestures. The vagabonds indulge in eve-teasing and molestation. Even grown up ladies are targeted and indecent remarks are passed at them.<br />
It is requested that police patrols must make more frequent visits to such places and take stringent action against the offenders and law-breakers.<br />
Yours faithfully Sachin President Students' Council</p>

<strong>Sub :</strong> Supply of Proper Drinking Water<br />
Sir,<br />
I want to draw your kind attention to the plight of our locality. Being one of the oldest ones of the city splendid, it is perhaps the most neglected one too.<br />
The water pipelines and sewer pipelines were laid about one hundred years ago. They intersect one another at many vital points. It seems that there is some seepage or leakage. For the last two days the drinking water supplied to the colony seems to be polluted. It emits a very foul smell. Some samples of this contaminated water are enclosed herewith for analysis at the government laboratory.<br />
May I add that polluted water is patently harmful to the health and well-being of the citizens. I, therefore, request you to order an immediate checking of the pipelines. Till proper drinking water supply is restored, you are requested to send tankers of potable water in the morning and evening to help the dwellers satisfy their needs.<br />
I do hope you will provide our colony with proper drinking water facilities.<br />
With thanks<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />

On behalf of the students of XII A, I would like to bring to your kind notice the predicament some of us are facing following the announcement of Pre-Board Examination Schedule. Some of us are taking the Entrance Examination for The Indian School of Languages which happens to clash with the date fixed for Pre-Board Test in English. Since, we cannot hope a change in date of the public examination, we earnestly appeal to you to shift the test in English by a week so that we may be able to appear in both. We know the importance of the Pre-Board Examination as it will evaluate our performance and inspire us in preparing in a better way.<br />

You will be pleased to know that I have been selected by Madhya Pradesh state to represent the state at the forthcoming National Athletic Meet at Delhi in the first week of October.<br />
The pre-competition Athletic coaching camp is being held from 10th September to 24 September 20XX. This fortnight long camp will begin at 6.00 a.m. and continue till 9.00 a.m. and then from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. I do not want to neglect my studies altogether. But circumstances constrain me. Much though I wish to reach the school in time, I fear I may be late by an hour.<br />
Keeping in view the circumstances detailed above, I request you to grant me permission to attend the school one hour late for a fortnight. The grace shown by you will keep me tension-free.<br />
I hope you will grant my request.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Frequent Digging up of Roads<br />
Sir,<br />
I would like to highlight the problems faced by the residents of Sector 19, Noida due to the frequent digging up of roads by various departments, such as electricity, water supply, sewage, telephones, etc. It seems that there is no coordination between these departments and the PWD. We have to put up with traffic diversions almost every fortnight. Great inconvenience is caused by the unfilled up pits and dust rising from the unsettled earth. The dug roads remain unrepaired and cause traffic hazards as well as accidents.<br />
We have written to the Development Authority many times, but our repeated efforts have failed to bear any fruit. Even today the roads are lying in a dug-up state.<br />
I hope the publication of the letter in your newspaper will draw the attention of the authorities to our plight and motivate them to expedite the repair work.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHORTAGE AND ERRATIC SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY</strong></p>
<p>You are Krishna, a resident of Ambedkar Nagar, Noida, and have been coming across certain headlines in the newspapers on shortage of electricity.

<strong>Sub:</strong> Shortage and Erratic Supply of Electricity in Ambedkar Nagar<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed paper I want to draw the attention of BSES towards the shortage and erratic electric supply in Amebedkar Nagar.<br />
Power cut has become almost a regular feature and electric supply comes to a halt during the odd hours. Very often it is too dim to see anything and thereby people get a lot of inconvenience. This causes a great loss to shopkeepers, students and housewives because all their work stops. This gives a good chance for the thieves to earn a good booty. The students are the worst hit. You know that these are the examination days and the students need electricity rather than blackout or shortage of light.<br />
Our repeated representation to BSES authorities have failed to yield the desirable results. Perhaps your intervention may relieve us from the menace and the authorities will regularise the supply.<br />
I hope that quick and effective steps will be taken.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />
Krishna</p>

<strong>Sub:</strong> Children targeted marketing<br />
Sir,<br />
I wish to draw the attention of the authorities in general and the parents in particular, towards certain malpractices carried on by the media in their advertisements. The manufacturers approve of these ads as they boost the sales of their products.<br />
Most of these ads have a mother and a child or two young children. The product is praised and its virtues extolled. The child or children in the ad seems to offer a suggestion to his/her peers-it is good for me/us; why don't you try it? Thus children become targets or prospective buyers. This trend may be fashionably termed as 'market strategy 5 or 'customer management', but it is certainly a malpractice. It exploits parents' love for their children. They can't refuse the demands of their child whether it is proper or improper. This new consumer-culture is doing more harm than good to the society. Will the concerned authorities pay attention to this malpractice and punish the errant ad agencies?<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THE GIRL CHILD</strong></p>
<p>You are Arun/Aruria Verma, living at 147, Sector 10, Rohini, New Delhi.

<strong>Sub:</strong> Discrimination against the girl child<br />
Sir,<br />
With deep concern, I write to you hoping to remove the discrimination that exists in our society against the girl child. It is incorrect to think that girl abuse exists only among rural illiterate people. I was dismayed to find evidence of this unjust practice even among educated, prosperous urban families. Daughters are not given quality food. Milk, eggs, fruit, etc., are reserved for the boys. Girls are sent to schools which have no claim to any quality education or facilities whereas the boys are sent to the most exclusive 'public schools'. After school the daughters stay at home and assist in housework, whereas the boys go out to play, meet friends or to movies and shows. Needless to say that girls have all kinds of restrictions on their movement regarding meeting friends, spending leisure.<br />
No argument can justify this injustice. Girls have the same talent, creativity and intelligence. They have more sensibility, love and affection. We should open our minds, have positive thinking and be fair to our daughters.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Poor Maintenance of Monuments<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to assert the fact that we Indians, particularly Delhiites do not value our heritage. We carelessly spoil our treasures. It can be seen in the attitude of our people towards the historical monuments. Delhi is rich in monuments. In Europe, such a legacy would be preserved and beautified but here it is spoiled and ruined by our own people through sheer ignorance, carelessness, laziness and disregard. In case you happen to visit the Red Fort, you will find not history but romantic messages.<br />
We must be proud of our city and its heritage. Then only we will be motivated to preserve its beauty and elegance. I appeal to fellow citizens to open their eyes and fall in love with the beauty of our city and help in its proper maintenance.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Nuisance of Polythene Litter bags<br />
Dear Sir<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to draw the attention of the government authorities to the nuisance caused by numerous polythene litter bags<br />
lying alongside the road early in the morning. It is not only an obnoxious sight but also a menace and health hazard as well.<br />
In order to keep their houses heat and clean, people throw litter bags anywhere. Thus they endanger the environment by causing pollution. Stray cattle poke into these polythene bags and scatter the filthy contents all around. Thus our colony virtually becomes a storehouse of garbage emitting foul smell and breeding flies, bacteria and other germs. I have written to the concerned authorities earlier also, but no action has been taken so far. I sincerely hope that my appeal will arouse the indolent officers from their slumber and make them respond to the call of duty.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Administrative apathy during drought<br />
Dear Sir<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I want to draw the attention of the public in general and the government in particular towards the plight of drought affected people and cattle of our district and the administrative apathy and utter neglect of relief measures.<br />
Every one is aware of the failure of rain for four successive years in our area. Consequently, there is a severe drought. Wells have dried up. The tanks and 'baolis' have become pits full of baked mud. Grass has been dried up. Even sturdy trees of acacia have shed their leaves. Some private agencies and non-government agencies have rushed food for men and fodder for animals, but this is not enough to meet the demand.<br />
We have written to the authorities concerned many times but they have been apathetic and disinterested. It is hoped that your editorial comments would lend force to my fervent appeal for rushing grain, water, and fodder to this famine-stricken area.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Menace of Stray Dogs in Kailash Park<br />
Sir,<br />
Delhi is the capital of India as well as a city of numerous problems viz traffic jams, power cut, diy taps and pollution. A new problem has cropped up recently-the problem of stray animals. Cows, pigs, donkeys and dogs are let off to feed on garbage. These animals cause road blocks and lead to serious road accidents besides polluting the environment. The menace of stray dogs has assumed alarming proportions. These dogs bark at the strangers as well as at the residents. The children are scared of moving out without an older member to escort them. Even the adults are afraid of dog-bites and the painful consequences. So they have to move out with sticks in hand.<br />
It is high time the authorities tackled this problem firmly. I hope the publication of my letter in your newspaper will attract the attention of the authorities and make them realise the gravity of the problem.<br />
Hope for a wide publicity.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Poor Maintenance of Public Park in Kailash Colony<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw the attention of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi towards the wretched condition of the public park in our colony.<br />
Our colony, Kailash Colony, was developed in the eighties, when much attention was not given to green belts. It has only one public park which is in an abject state. It seems a picture of utter neglect. The boundary wall is broken at several places. Consequently, stray cows and dogs wander inside at will. Some undesirable elements and beggars sleep on the benches at night. There is no watchman or gardener to look after its maintenance. People are wary of going to the park early in the morning or late in the evening. Thus the park has become a nuisance to the residents.<br />
It is hoped that after reading our plight in the newspaper the authorities will be roused to take remedial steps. So far all our appeals and letters to the authorities have failed to elicit any response from them. Hope this letter does the trick.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Increasing Pollution and Uncleanliness<br />
Sir,<br />
Chandigarh is known as the 'City Beautiful' and we are rightly proud of being privileged citizens of this modern city. Of late, however, some disturbing trends have been noticed. The volume of vehicular traffic has spurted manifold. Many factories have sprung up in the vicinity of the city. The smoke emitted by the chimneys of these factories or spewed out by the fast plying vehicles have made the fives of citizens miserable. Pollution has increased to intolerable limits. The .heaps of garbage and unclean roads compound the problem. Some voluntary organisations have organised cleanliness campaigns in Sector 7 and 14 and are creating social awareness by educating the masses against the dangers of pollution. Kindly publish this letter with your editorial comments to make the citizens aware of these drawbacks. I do hope that the people of Chandigarh will cooperate to keep their city clean.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Involvement of Domestic Servants in Crime<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw the attention of the public in general and police authorities in particular towards a problem which deserves immediate attention and necessary action. It has been observed that the acts of crime such as theft, house-breaking, kidnapping and murders are increasing day by day. Newspaper reports reveal that persons working in houses for cleaning, cooking, etc. are involved, directly or indirectly in such acts of crime. They either collude with<br />
anti-social elements to make easy money or indulge in the heinous and nefarious act of stealing, kidnapping and murder themselves.<br />
I think the police should make it mandatory for people engaging domestic servants to get clearance from the local police station after registration and proper verification. The police must show alertness and far-sightedness while dealing with such cases.<br />
I do hope you will spare some time to look into this problem.<br />
Thank you<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Health Hazards Caused by the Junk Food<br />
Sir,<br />
Kindly spare me some space in the columns of your esteemed daily. I want to recount my experiences and sufferings as a consumer of fast food, which is growing in popularity among teenagers. I, too, had been a votary of junk food and relished all types of food which tempted my tongue and palate. Little did I realise then that all these dishes of fried food with lot of fats and spices are unwholesome and a potent danger to health. The first effect of junk food was visible in the form of obesity. I became overweight. The doctors advised me to reduce weight by running, jogging and taking exercises. I felt breathlessness and exhaustion too soon and too quickly. The accumulated fat and excessive weight increased the palpitations of my heart and I became a victim of heart disease. Now I have been forced by circumstances to give up fast food altogether.<br />
I would, therefore, request all persons, especially the teenagers, to avoid eating junk food. It is hazardous to health. Simple, home-made food cooked hygienically is the best for us. I am confident you will give a wide publicity to my views.<br />

Through the columns of your esteemed paper, I want to express my concern over the suffering of the common man due to steep rise in prices of essential commodities. It has been observed that prices of essential commodities like wheat, rice, pulses, milk, vegetables, etc. are rising almost every month. Businessmen create artificial scarcity by hoarding stocks of essential commodities. Malfunctioning of public distribution system encourages the black-marketeers. Neither the grower nor the consumer is happy. It is the middlemen who fleece the two. The common man is the worst sufferer.<br />
I appeal to the authorities to take steps to control the rising prices and take strong action against the hoarders and black marketeers.<br />

Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed paper, I want to draw the attention of public in general and police authorities in particular towards the increasing incidence of injuries and death taking place due to underage driving in Delhi. In most cases, these drivers having no driving licence hit and run away. The police arrives late and the offenders go scot free.<br />
There is not a single day when there is no road accident involving teenagers. Driving fast has become a craze and a status symbol for rich teenagers. Their parents allow them to drive on road without caring for the fives of others.<br />
Sir, through these columns, I would like to request the police authorities to be very strict in such cases. Those who are found guilty of reckless driving should be given exemplary punishment. There should be strict action against the parents who allow their underage children to drive on roads.<br />
I hope parents will be watchful and the police will take strict steps to stop this practice.<br />

Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your newspaper I would like to draw the attention of the concerned authorities to the appalling condition of the roads leading to the main market.<br />
The entire stretch is full of people. All sorts of traffic can be seen here. Roadside vendors occupy most of the space on roads. They cover the pavements and leave no room for parking. What is worse, they occupy at least one third of the road and disturb the flow of traffic. The worst hit are the pedestrians. They are virtually caught between the devil and the deep sea. Moving on the road has become a nightmare for them.<br />
We have already brought this problem to the notice of municipal authorities, but no tangible action has been taken so far. I think that certain steps are essential. The vendors must be issued licence and allotted specific space. Those who break the rules must be fined.<br />
Prompt action on the part of the authorities will curb this problem and make the flow of traffic free and safe for the citizens.<br />

<li>The garbage disposal system is very poor. It is only once in a blue moon that a truck visits the area to collect household refuse.</li>
<li>The area lacks in even basic amenities like public transport. The city bus service has not taken cognisance of this colony so far. Those who depend on public transport have no option but to walk to the main road.</li>
<li>Luck of co-operative store forces the residents to buy household goods from the private shopkeepers. We get sub-standard goods at higher prices.</li>

<strong>Sub:</strong> Frequent Power Failure<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities towards the problem of frequent power failure in our locality.<br />
The summer season is at its peak and the consumption of electricity has increased manifold. We understand that the electricity board cannot meet the demand as it gets limited supply. The citizens have adapted their lifestyle to the hours of official/scheduled power cuts. The problem arises when there are sudden, frequent breakdowns for hours together in the name of repairs, replacements of transformers or new electric lines. Our colony is the worst hit as we have to spend many dark hours without electricity. We have contacted the electricity department many times and acquainted them with our problems/grievances. We got sweet polite words and assurances but nothing tangible has been done so far to alleviate the sufferings of the consumers.<br />
It is requested that some new transformers of greater capacity should be installed. Secondly, power cuts should be limited to the hours already announced/published in newspapers.<br />
I hope these steps will provide some relief from the frequent power failure in the summer months.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Environmental Degradation and Pollution<br />
Sir,<br />
I wish to draw the attention of the authorities towards the problems faced by the residents of Chetna Vihar due to environmental degradation and pollution in our colony. The abject sanitary conditions prevailing in our locality are a testimony to the utter neglect on the part of the civic authorities. It seems that cleaners have forgotten the existence of this locality on the civic map of Delhi. Heaps of rubbish are lying here and there, with flies swarming around and pigs wallowing in the filth and mud caused by the overflow of dirty water from the choked drains on to the road. The drains are neither cleaned nor flushed regularly. The dirty water collects on the road forming cesspools of filthy water. It emits a foul stench. There are also many pits on the roads which are full of drain water. All these serve as breeding places for mosquitoes. It is feared that the locality may fall victim to malaria or dengue.<br />
Timely action on the part of the Health Department can check the further deterioration of the insanitary condition. The sanitary inspector must pay visit regularly and supervise the performance of the cleaners deployed in this locality. Insecticides may be sprayed from time to time. I do hope that these steps will help to improve the health and hygiene in our locality.<br />

Senior Secondary School and citizens of central market-the heart of the city of Mangalore. While going to school in the morning, I notice many stray animals wandering here and there on the busy market roads. The position is almost the same-a repeat performance in the afternoon. Sometimes these stray animals cross the roads in a long unending array, thus causing traffic blocks as well as accidents. These animals create a health hazard by urinating everywhere. Huge heaps of dung are lying here and there. Flies hover over them and insects breed inside them. We have already written to the authorities but no action has been taken so far. Kindly highlight the issue with your editorial comments so that officials are deputed to catch these stray animals and send them to the police pen. If unclaimed, these might be auctioned.<br />

The entire stretch is narrow, congested and covered with numerous potholes. This often causes a traffic jam and inconvenience to students and staff of the school. A lot of time is wasted both in the morning and afternoon when the school buses have to leave.<br />

<p>Applications for jobs are written in a very formal, precise and to the point manner. In case the applicant has to focus on his qualifications and experience, a bio-data is enclosed. It includes important information regarding the candidate such as Name, Date of Birth, Contact Address, Educational Qualifications, Professional attainments, Experience, Hobbies, Marital Status, Salary Expected and the References. The forwarding letter has the same format as an official letter. In case, the information about the applicant is not detailed one, it is included in the body of the letter itself.<br />
The bio-data or curriculum vitae (C.V.) is written in a standardized format. The forwarding letter reflects the personality of the writer. It must be brief and polite. While stressing personal qualities such as habits, manners, health, physique etc., it should avoid the two extremes of bragging and ingratiating.<br />
Study the following solved examples:</p>

I do assure you of my dedicated service and wholehearted co-operation.<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />

I want to draw your kind attention to one shortcoming in your otherwise good institution. I happened to go to one of the toilets for students after a school function. I attended this function as the guardian of my younger brother. I was shocked to see the condition of the toilets. There was a foul stench all around. Yellow patches caused by urine were visible everywhere. There was no proper flushing and cleaning of the pots of the toilets. Some of them seemed to be blocked and caused overflow of filthy water. The walls bore ugly graffiti.<br />
Since toilet is 6m essential facility, proper cleanliness and maintenance is a must. I do hope you will pay attention to this most essential problem.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Lack of Proper Arrangement of Clean Drinking Water<br />
Madam,<br />
During a recent meeting of PTA, I happened to visit your school .as the guardian of my younger sister. I was deeply impressed by the standard of cleanliness and discipline in your school. One thing, however, irked me most. It is the lack of proper arrangement of clean drinking water in the school. Although summer has not yet begun, I found long queues of thirsty students in hunt of the water coolers on the ground floor. I saw some students quenching their thirst from water taps on the first and second floors.<br />
Supply of clean, germ-free water is an essential part of the facilities the school should offer. I suggest that immediate steps should be taken to instal boosters to provide a running supply of water to the water coolers on the first and second floors.<br />
I hope you will take urgent steps in this regard.<br />

Respected Sir,<br />
With due regards I would like to bring to your kind notice towards our difficulties and feelings. We all know that we have no playground in our school, but we have a bunch of students who are very good hockey players. Due to non-availability of playground all the players cannot practise as a team. The interzonal school tournaments are to commence within a fortnight. As the captain of our school hockey team, I feel morally bound that our players have proper co-ordination and play as a team and not as a bunch of players grouped together.<br />
For this purpose, we need playground facilities. I, therefore, earnestly request you to arrange playground facilities from a neighbouring school in the morning/evening for an hour or two so that we may practise together under the guidance of our coach.<br />
I hope to have a favourable consideration.<br />

Sir,<br />
With due respect, I would like to submit the following facts for your kind consideration. As you know, the summer is in full swing. The temperature has already crossed 40°C. The afternoons are very hot. As the classes of the boys are held in the second shift, we have to bear the brunt of the heat. To add to our plight, the electricity department resorts to frequent and unannounced power-cuts. This irregular supply of electricity hinders our studies as it affects our concentration and efficiency. You know that our NDA exams are to be held in June. We are preparing hard for the forthcoming examinations.<br />
In the welfare of all the students, I request you to arrange for a generator of high power in the school so as to avoid the inconvenience caused to the learners by irregular supply of electricity. I am optimistic that you would take necessary steps to provide generator facility to all of us at your earliest convenience.<br />

Sir,<br />
During my visit to your school in connection with P.T.A. meeting, I happened to go to the library. I would like to draw your attention to the malfunctioning of the library. I sincerely feel that it can prove more useful to the students if a few steps are taken to tone it up.<br />
I was shocked at the disorderliness in the library. Books were lying in heaps and were not restored to the proper shelves. No wonder the book which the library has is reported to be non-available by the library staff. The lack of cooperation from the library staff makes the situation worse. You may take steps to make them alert and willing workers. The shortage/non-availability of books, if any, may be made up by buying more copies of the volumes more in demand. The old and broken tables and chairs may be got repaired if not replaced.<br />
I hope that during our next meeting we shall find the library cosy, spick and span.<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Request for More Books for the Library<br />
Madam,<br />
Being the guardian of a student of your school, I would like to register my complaint against insufficient number 6f reference books in the school library. During one of my visits 1 came to know that CBSE has changed the style of questions in English. It has supplied a book of questions to every school. I have not been able to procure one from the market. My sister Nita could not get one from the library. On enquiring from the librarian, she came to know that the copies of the book containing the Question Bank in English are insufficient. It is certainly a hurdle as lack of proper books hinders learning activity.<br />
You know the importance of books in this competitive age. This particular book has become indispensable for the students as it informs them about the style and types of questions and thus guides them in preparation and helps them in self evaluation.<br />
I, therefore, request you to take necessary steps in order to increase the number of textbooks as well as reference books in such a manner that they would meet the demands of the students.<br />
I do hope you'll consider my request.<br />

I would like to draw your kind attention towards the need of bringing improvement in our school canteen. Our school canteen is just an apology for a canteen. It is housed in an old dingy, ill ventilated room. Though the school has more than 2500 students, but the canteen has only 25 chairs and most of them are broken. There is a huge rush during the recess. Students who go there in their vacant periods find it in bad shape. The contractor pays no attention to the quality of the eatables served here, though the prices are exorbitant. No effort is made to keep the place neat and clean.<br />
I request you to kindly pay a surprise visit to the canteen and make an on the spot appraisal. In case you are convinced of the genuineness of our observation, please ask the canteen committee to take immediate steps to improve the situation.<br />

Sir,<br />
It is a matter of pride for all of us that our school ranks very high in Delhi both in academie and co-curricular fields. Every year the school students figure among the top ten in various board results and win distinction for school in sports, science exhibitions and republic day participations. It is all due to your patronage, guidance and the hard labour and keen interest evinced by the staff and students.<br />
However, I would like to mention one thing that leaves a bad impression on the mind of the visitors. The school premises needs a face-lift. I am offering some concrete suggestions in this regard.<br />
The school lawn is in wilderness. The flower beds are neglected and the grass is unmown. Either the school gardener is unmindful of his duty or he has been assigned some other job. The school library must be spruced up as its ugly looks are an eyesore. Its bare inner walls can be made more beautiful by displaying pictures of renowned scholars and writers. Some quotable quotes here and there can add to the beauty.<br />
I earnestly hope you will give due consideration to my suggestions.<br />

I further submit, Sir, that I took a keen interest in co-curricular activities during my stay at the school. I was a member of the school hockey team which won the district championship last year. I was also declared the best speaker in the Interschool Debate Contest. I also worked as Secretary of the School Debate Club last year. I have always been respectful and well-behaved. There has not been a single report against me. My teachers will testify to my work, worth and character.<br />
Yours obediently<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Introduction of Biology<br />
Sir,<br />
As a former student of the school, I request you to introduce Biology as one of the subjects in our school in senior secondary classes. Our school has excellent facilities for physics and chemistry, but there is no provision for the learning of Biology.<br />
Biology is a very important subject for the students who have to seek admission in MBBS course. Since we do not have this particular subject in the senior secondary classes, our students will always have a major drawback if they want to compete for the Entrance Test leading to admission in MBBS course. Private coaching is no substitute for regular<br />
classes. In the present competition oriented times, where professionalism is the order of the day, it becomes imperative to have thorough knowledge in the field where one's interest lies.<br />
If the subject of Biology is introduced in our school, it will prevent unnecessary inconvenience to students who have to migrate to other schools after passing the tenth standard for want of their desired subject.<br />
I am optimistic to hear a positive response in this matter from you at the earliest.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Lokesh</p>

<strong>Sub:</strong> Facility of Learning Computers<br />
Sir,<br />
As the head boy of school, I would like to put before you a genuine need of the students. Our school is one of the leading schools in the state and famous for its academic excellence. We students, however, feel handicapped in one respect only. Our school is lacking in facility of computer education.<br />
The need of computer education is felt nowadays by everyone. We know that the modern age is moving fast. The frontiers of knowledge are spreading fast and unfolding something new every moment. To cope with the inflow of scientific and technical data, knowledge of computers is a must. The computers play a vital role in banks, business houses, railways, airlines, science laboratories and research centres. Without effective training in computer learning, the students will not be equipped to cope with the problems they are likely to face in the forthcoming career. If we have to compete with other countries in the field of science and technology, the knowledge-of computers must be imparted at an early age.<br />
Keeping in view the facts stated above, I request you to arrange computer learning facility in our school at the earliest.<br />
Hope to have a favourable consideration.<br />
Yours obediently<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PARAGRAPHS FOR READING SKILLS</strong></p>

<strong>Sub:</strong> Reduction in Number of Paragraphs for Reading Skills<br />
Sir,<br />
I agree with the maxim that exams are the test of one's knowledge, skill and ability. But I am not in favour of the number of paragraphs set for reading comprehension and note¬making. These passages tend to be tedious and boring. The students have to spend more time to read, analyse and understand them and answer the questions. The result is that students fail to complete the paper within the prescribed time limit. Thus these passages harass the students. They do not relish writing answers to them.<br />
In view of the poor performance of the students in reading skills, I request you, sir, to consider the case of reducing the number of paragraphs for reading skills. I am confident that two passages of shorter lengths will unable students to give better performance. Hope to have a favourable consideration.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Curriculum of SUPW<br />
Sir,<br />
The curriculum of SUPW (Socially Useful Productive Work) is quite vast and contains many interesting and useful activities. The choice of subjects/projects has been left to the institutions. This has led to a very disturbing state. Many schools have no provision or facilities for the hobbies/subjects introduced for the senior secondary classes. There is no field work or practical participation of students. These periods are reduced to one-way lectures only. The students are so disillusioned that they call SUPW as 'some useful periods wasted'. It will be better to prescribe a limited number of crafts/hobbies suiting the local conditions and availability of raw material. Please try to make the curriculum of SUPW relevant and effective for real life.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Request to open a career counselling centre<br />
Sir,<br />
My son, Anuj, is a student of class X in your school and is currently appearing in the Board examination. Very soon, he and other students of his class will have to make an important decision. They will have to select the stream/subjects they should opt for at the +2 level. As you know, this is the most crucial decision of a student's life. Most of the parents are unaware of the latest trends in educational/job fields. I, therefore, request you to kindly open a career counselling centre in your school to help your students make the correct choice according to their aptitudes/talents as well as future job prospects. Expert guidance in the field will prove invaluable to the young students.<br />
I hope you will consider my request favourably.<br />
With regards and best wishes.<br />
Yours faithfully<br />

<strong>Sub:</strong> Extra Classes in Maths<br />
Sir,<br />
The other day we were admonished about poor performance in Maths in the Pre-Board Examination. We have tried to search our souls, rack our brains and find out the fault. The reason is quite obvions. Our Maths lecturer retired in August and stop-gap arrangements were made for three months by appointing temporary hands. Only last month we were<br />
able to get the guidance from an expert and competent teacher like Mr. B.M. Garg. However, a lot of our course remains uncovered and proper justice cannot be done to it in the regular periods only. .    .<br />
Moreover, we have to make up our deficiency. Drill, revision and classroom tests also require certain periods. In view of the paucity of time available to us between now and the commencement of board examination, it is requested that some extra classes before/after school hours be arranged in Maths for XI and XII classes.<br />
I hope that the request of the students will be acceded to without any delay.<br />
Yours obediently<br />
Rajani Walia<br />
Head Girl</p>

<p>A composition is a written attempt to describe an event, an experience, a thing or a fact. It may contain the views, ideas and opinions of the writer on a topic of general interest. The thought stimuli may be visual or verbal but it must be vividly apprehended.<br />
Students have to observe certain limits of words, time and even space. They are supposed to write their compositions in about 150-200 words expressing their views or the descriptive/ narrative note content of the subject mentioned. Hence, they are advised not to exceed the given word limit. Students have to combine information with their own opinions, suggestions, etc. Hence you are advised to give your own point of view rather than reproducing hackneyed, expected opinions and ideas.<br />
The composition, whether it be an article, a report, a speech, a description, or a narration, should be meaningful, brief, to the point and couched in a simple and grammatically correct language. For the benefit of the students, examples-exercises have been arranged in the following order:<br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 1:</span></strong><br />
You are Rachana/Rakesh. You have been asked to write an article for your school magazine titled 'The Sights and Sounds of Our City'. You decide to observe a busy street in the main shopping area to collect material for your article. You note the following: -quiet in the morning-crowded in the afternoon-housewives out shopping-vehicular traffic-noise-vendors occupying pavements-stray cattle on the road-evening-lights transform the scene-people out for strolling-eating.<br />
Write your article in 150-200 words using the above notes and your own ideas.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF OUR CITY</strong><br />
(by Rachana/Rakesh)</p>
<p>Railway Road of our city is a very busy street. It has shops, eating places and residential accommodation above the shops. The pavements on either side are occupied by the vendors. There are small kiosks of 'pan-wallahs' and the ironing man. The cobblers, vegetable sellers and cheap ready-made clothes sellers sit on the ground in front of the shops. Thus the wide road is reduced to a narrow lane.<br />
There is peace and quietness in the morning as there is very little activity in the market. Children and adults are busy at home. The street comes to life as the day advances and the shops start opening. By 11 o'clock the street begins to hum with activities. People from villages start pouring in for shopping. Afternoons are busier as local housewives also go for shopping. As early evening approaches, more vegetable and fruit vendors appear. The scene is transformed with the switching on of lights. The atmosphere becomes bright, gay and festive. Well-dressed people can be seen shopping for children and visiting restaurants. It is indeed a time for family outing. Roads are crowded as people start coming back from offices, factories and outstations. The only blemish in this street is that stray cattle-cows, buffaloes, dogs, pigs and monkeys-wander freely on the road and cause inconvenience to all.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:</span></strong><br />
You are Aditi/Aditya. You visited the Taj at Agra during the Autumn break when the Historical Society of your school organised a trip. You were impressed and noted the following points:<br />
Autumn break-school closed-trip to Agra organised-journey-Taj Express-first sight of the Taj-impressions-History teacher as guide-some other places visited- Red Fort, Fatehpur Sikri-trip: educative &amp; entertaining.<br />
Using the above notes and your own ideas, write an article on 'A visit to a Place of Historical Interest' in 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A VISIT TO A PLACE OF HISTORICAL INTEREST</strong><br />
(by Aditi / Aditya)</p>
<p>The schools in Delhi closed for autumn break on Saturday, the 27th September. The Historical Society of our school arranged a trip to Agra. We started early in the morning the next day by the Taj Express. The two hour journey was very pleasant and quite comfortable. After half-an-hour we had the first glimpse of the Taj. It is indeed a marvel in marble, one of the wonders of the world. The serene beauty of the Taj cast a spell on me. It appeared to me like a dream in marble. Our History teacher<br />
played the role of a guide as well. He explained each part of this monument in detail. Then we visited other places of historical interest such as the Red Fort and the Moti Masjid. The visit to Fatehpur Sikri and the 'Buland Darwaja' filled us with excitement. This historical town is now uninhabited. On the whole, the trip proved very educative and entertaining. For the first time History appeared as a vivid and living subject.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 3:</span></strong><br />
In most Indian families, particularly in rural areas, the girl child is considered inferior to the male child. As a result of this bias, a daughter is considered a burden and she suffers discrimination in the matter of food, freedom, health and education. Write an article in 150-200 words showing how such an attitude is harmful and unjust. You are Satyen/Sunidhi.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EVILS OF GENDER DISCRIMINATION</strong><br />
(by Satycn /Surddhi)</p>
<p>In our male-dominated society the girl child is considered inferior. The birth of a male child is an event for celebration while that of a female child is rued. The bias is more pronounced in rural areas. Daughters are not given good quality food. Milk, eggs, fruit, etc. are reserved for the boys. Girls are sent to schools which have no claim to any quality education or facilities. On the other hand, boys are sent to the most exclusive 'public schools'. After school the daughters stay at home and assist in household work. The boys go out to meet friends, enjoy movies and shows or play games. It is the girls who face all types of restrictions. This discrimination is unjust and harmful. Ultimately it is the society that suffers. Girls too have intelligence, talent and creativity. Indeed they have more sensibility, affection and love. We should end the evil discrimination against the girl child.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 4:<br />
</span></strong>The Information Technology has provided new avenues to the students for knowledge, creativity, discovery as well as job opportunities at home and abroad. Computers have brought in a silent revolution. Write an article in 150-200 words showing how the information technology has provided the younger generation new opportunities, joys of discovery and thrill of creativity. You are Madhu/Mudit.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND YOUNGER GENERATION</strong><br />
(by Madhu/Mudit)</p>
<p>The Information Technology has provided new avenues to the students for acquiring knowledge, enhancing thrills of creativity, enjoying pleasures of discovery as well as new job opportunities at home and abroad. Computers have brought in a silent revolution. These electronic devices are as efficient as the best of human brains. Computers have become indispensable in data-processing and resource planning. Access to Internet&#8217; has opened vast field of knowledge to the computer-operator. Computer is more than a calculating machine. No doubt it has made lengthy calculations and working out tedious problems a matter of fun. In writing articles too it helps like a good friend by correcting spellings and grammatical errors. Web-designing, e-mail and e-commerce are quite engrossing and rewarding.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 5:<br />
</span></strong>Our country is prone to disasters like floods, drought, cyclones, or earthquakes. Ad hoc measures are adopted to cope with every disaster. The slow response results in loss of human life and property. Write an article for a newspaper giving suggestions about disaster management. You may suggest having special equipment, trained personnel, better transport and communication, quick decisions and speedy implementation. Your article should be of 150-200 words. You are Shishir/Shweta.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DISASTER MANAGEMENT</strong><br />
(by Shishir /Shweta)</p>
<p>Our country is prone to disasters like floods, drought, cyclones, or earthquakes. We do not have any clear-cut policy of disaster management nor any force to tackle the situation. Ad hoc measures are adopted to cope with every disaster. We wait and watch for others to join the fray. There are heated arguments over jurisdiction-centre or state liability, official assessment and surveys before any help is rushed out to the affected area. The slow response results in the loss of precious human life and valuable property. We must have clear-cut, well defined guidelines for disaster management. A well-trained task-force having special equipment and trained personnel should be constituted. Its controlling officer should have the authority to take decisions and ensure their speedy implementation. Better transport and communication facilities will ensure better results. Bureaucratic set-up should not be allowed to interfere with the work of the disaster-management group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 6:</span></strong><br />
Hypocrisy exists in abundant measure in our society. People do not practise what they preach. They have double standards; are rude and dishonest but expect politeness and honesty from others.- There are numerous examples of lack of sincerity in our daily experience. Write an article of 150-200 words showing how such behaviour causes disharmony at home, in the neighbourhood and at the work place. You are Harsha/ Hrishit.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HYPOCRISY</strong><br />
(by Harsha/Hrishit)</p>
<p>My neighbour shows great concern for the poor, but beats his fourteen-year-old servant black and blue. Mr Seth, the rich man living in that palatial house expects the government to do everything for him, but he evades paying taxes. The pious old woman upstairs feeds the sacred cow, the ants and the birds but is merciless to her neighbour's pet dog and kicks, shoos away and beats the poor pup whenever it strays over to her path. Thus in small matters and big ones, we find people lacking sincerity in their dealings with others. The consequences of such hypocritical and discriminatory behaviour are quite damaging and harmful. These cause a breach in the family. Love is lost between brothers and family ties are weakened. Our neighbours begin to lose faith in us. Suspicion and selfishness replace trust and dedicated service. Thus good neighbourliness is broken and community living is vitiated by the virus of hypocrisy. In work place too dishonesty can bring ruin to the flourishing business. Hence people should control their selfishness and be truthful in their dealings.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 7:</span></strong><br />
You are Renu/Rohit. Write an article of 150-200 words for your school magazine on ' Journalism as a Career'. You may use the following points as well as ideas of your own. Journalism: Suitable for those good at languages-who desire to present the truth to the public-challenging &amp; mobile-new forms: TV news, sports, travel, Journalism- can bring name, fame and money-needs courage and honesty.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>JOURNALISM AS A CAREER</strong><br />
(by Renu/Rohit)</p>
<p>Among the numerous careers open to youngsters, journalism is perhaps one of the most challenging, mobile and adventurous but also rewarding. Journalism is not everyone's cup of tea. It requires special skills, the primary and essential ones being good command of language. Only those who can use language effectively should opt<br />
for this career. Journalism is concerned with current affairs. Therefore, those who aspire to be journalists should have keen interest and awareness of politics, international affairs and social studies. Journalists are the most active arm of media. The impact of media on the general public is quite powerful. Hence great responsibility rests on journalists. Investigative journalism is the latest breed. It aims to unravel the truth behind appearances. Some investigative journalists, like Arun Shourie, have achieved name, fame and phenomenal success through their writings. Some new forms of journalism are sports, films, TV news and travel journalism. It is a challenging career for the youth. It has great prospects but demands courage, integrity and the capacity to rough it out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 8:</span></strong><br />
You are Astitva/Ashita. This year students of your school organised many campaigns to create awareness in society towards some of the rampant social evils. The efforts of your school were appreciated by the press and the public alike. Write an article on the 'Role of Students in National Development' for publication in The Indian Express (word limit 150-200).<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ROLE OF STUDENTS IN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</strong><br />
(by Astitva/Ashita)</p>
<p>Students are the pride and glory of a nation. They can play a very constructive role in the progress, uplift and development of a country. In the new millennium information technology has turned the world into a global village. Our educated youth have a tremendous responsibility on their young shoulders. Our country is overpopulated and beset with poverty, ignorance, illiteracy and superstitions. The young students can play a positive and constructive role in every field of national development. They can enlighten the villagers about new techniques in agriculture. By making them literate, the students can provide them valuable guidance in establishing cooperative societies. This will help in generating money through self-employment. In short, they can bring a transformation in the society.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 9:</span></strong><br />
You are Sudhir Ranjan of Cambridge Sr. Secondary School, Gurgaon. You attended a hiking and trekking expedition to the hills, organised by your school during the summer vacation. Write an article (in about 150-200 words) for your school magazine expressing your opinions about the tour and suggestions for improvement.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HIKING &amp; TREKKING EXPEDITION</strong><br />
(by Sudhir Ranjan)</p>
<p>Our hiking and trekking expedition to Gaumukh, the source of river Ganga in Garhwal Himalayas was partly successful. We had to hire ponies to cover difficult terrains. Sometimes we had to seek help of vehicles to accommodate two or three members of our trekking party who either suffered from exhaustion or lack of acclimatization. In spite of these minor irritants we managed to reach Uttarkashi from where we hired some equipment for our expedition to Gangotri. Situated at a height of 3048 metres, Gangotri was a bit of disappointment. It was not only overcrowded with pilgrims but the ashrams were commercialised. Most of the pilgrims don't go beyond Gangotri. We walked 11 km to Bhojbasa at a height of 12000 feet. Next morning we started for Gaumukh which was still 4-5 km away. The trekking to the altitude of 3892 metres over boulders and glaciers was a challenging experience. However, the sight of the Ganga rushing out of the mouth of the glacier in a thundering torrent made us forget all fatigue. It was a bliss.<br />
In future only sturdy students who can cope with long walks in difficult terrains should be selected.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 10:</span></strong><br />
Ritu, a student of XI class of St. Mary's Convent, Kanpur, is shocked by the communal disturbance and riots in the city. She discusses the issue with her teacher, who tells her about India's secularism, democracy and socialism and the efforts of religious fanatics to spread communal hatred which cripples economy and hinders development. Motivated by the discussion, Ritu writes an article on the 'Bane of Communalism' for her school magazine (word limit: 150-200). Write the article for her.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BANE OF COMMUNALISM</strong><br />
(by Ritu)</p>
<p>Communalism is a black spot on the fair name of secular India. The cancer of communalism is eating into the vitals of our nation. Every year we have communal riots and arsoning in one big city or the other. Cities like Aligarh, Meerut, Moradabad, Kanpur and Ahmedabad have frequent communal riots.<br />
The root cause of communalism is religious intolerance. It is fanned by religious fanatics who spread communal hatred in order to feather their own nest. These narrow¬minded persons suffering from sectarian or communal prejudices lack a rational, scientific and democratic approach. They harm the nation by crippling economy and hinder the development. Communalism has also been spread by self-seeking politicians. It is high time that the organizations and the people who divide people in the name of religion and block the progress of secular, socialist and democratic India should be brought to book.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 11:<br />
</span></strong>You are Rahul/Rashmi. You come across news item of migration of talented and highly educated young professionals to the advanced countries for good salaries and perks or due to lack of proper facilities. The news item hints the loss to the parent nation in terms of talent and resources. Using these points and your own ideas write an article on The Menace of Brain-Drain for publication in 'The Hindustan Times'.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE MENACE OF BRAIN DRAIN</strong><br />
(by Rahul /Rashmi)</p>
<p>India is facing a problem of tremendous magnitude these days. It is man-made. Every other day we come across news items of migration of talented and highly educated young professionals to the advanced countries of Europe and America for good salaries and perks or due to lack of proper facilities. This continuous brain drain of talent has affected our nation adversely. India and its people are deprived of the fruit of their knowledge and experience. Their migration, sometimes desertion for ever, causes a severe loss to the parent nation in terms of talent and resources. It is admitted that India lacks facilities and equipment that developed countries offer. Moreover, our organizations suffer from red-tape, corruption and nepotism. Stagnation and lack of promotion cause disappointment and despair. Effective steps should be taken to retain the best brains in our country.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 12:</span></strong><br />
India has been facing and fighting terrorism for the last twenty years. In fact terrorism has disrupted the peace and harmony of the country and created panic and insecurity in certain areas/states. Write an article in about 150-200 words on 'Terrorism : A Curse to Humanity'. You are Deepak/Jyoti.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TERRORISM : A CURSE TO HUMANITY</strong><br />
(by Deepak/Jyotï)</p>
<p>Terrorism is the biggest threat that the world faces today. Modem terrorism thrives on its ability to hit where it hurts the most. The aim of the terrorists is to create fear, anxiety, panic and disturbance in the minds of the common people. They believe in destruction and death and create lawlessness. At present innocent citizens are becoming the victims of terror and violence. Hapless citizens are used as pawns and ransoms for exerting pressure on governments. Sometimes governments too feel helpless and yield to their unlawful and exorbitant demands for money, material and release of fellow terrorists. As the authorities bow to demands of terrorists, citizens lose faith in government. Terrorists attacked the twin towers in America, on September 11, 2001 killing thousands of persons. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been infested by terrorists. Even the Indian Parliament was the target of attack on 13th December, 2001. The latest was the Mumbai attack on the Taj Hotel on 26 Nov., 2008. The government should enact strict laws to combat this evil against humanity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 13:</span></strong><br />

As Manish/Manju, write a composition of 150-200 words showing how computers have opened up a new world of discovery and opportunity for the youth today.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>

Write an article to be published in your school magazine on how the cable TV is both a boon and a bane. Your article should not exceed 200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CABLE TV-A BOON OR A BANE</strong><br />
(by Namit/Neha)</p>
<p>Television has brought a wonderful transformation in the lifestyle and outlook of people. Through news and views, documentaries and short films it has highlighted social problems like the evils of dowry system, black marketing, adulteration, corruption, political-bribe taking campaign, etc. Several national development programmes such as family planning, adult education, small savings campaign, eye-donation, blood donation, tree-plantation and anti-pollution drives have been made familiar to us through television. Cable TV operates a step forward. It provides us serials, plays, live musicals, live sports, face-to-face interactions with eminent persons and instant news. But cable TV has a thorn al§o. Children sit glued to it. They go on watching their programmes and eating junk food. They are expanding their knowledge but tending to be obese and physically inactive. These couch-potatoes are also becoming stubborn, uncivil, ill mannered and violent as a result of exposure to violence, nudeness and foreign culture on the screen. In this sense TV is a bane. Parents should advise their children to choose programmes carefully.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 15:</span></strong><br />
Meenakshi, a student of class XI feels highly disturbed when she reads about the hike in the prices of essential commodities like gas, pulses, vegetables etc. Write an article on 'Price-hike of Essential Commodities' for publication in a local daily, suggesting certain steps to curb this menace.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRICE-HIKE OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES</strong><br />
(by Meenakshi)</p>
<p>Prices of essential commodities like gas, pulses, vegetables, etc. have been rising steadily for the last many years. The escalation of prices hits the common man and the salaried classes the most. Leaders talk of removing poverty and holding the price line, but the consumers have to shell out more money every year for maintaining their standard of living. Defective planning, deficit financing, lack of dynamic price- regulation policy, anti-social tendencies like hoarding, black-marketing and avarice to become rich overnight are the root cause .of this problem. The middle man fleeces the grower as well as consumer. The trade is in the hands of private traders. Govt, efforts to provide essential articles through ration shops are limited to only people below poverty line. There is an urgent need of a cooperative movement to act as a bridge between the farmer and the consumer and eliminate the profit hungry trader. People should join hands to curb the anti-social mediators in their deal making compaigns.</p>

To enforce strict discipline in schools and colleges is a great problem these days when cases of indiscipline have become quite frequent. Taking help of the points given below, write an article on the importance of discipline in life in about 150-200 words. You are Chitra/Chetan.<br />
Discipline-order-sense of duty &amp; obedience-essential in all walks of life-absence: chaos and confusion-Home: nursery of discipline-indiscipline in educational institutions-strikes-demonstrations-boycott of classes-elections to students' unions. Political interference-proper counselling and guidance by parents and teachers.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>IMPORTANCE OF DISCIPLINE</strong><br />
(by Chitra/Chetan)</p>
<p>Discipline ensures order. It is the basis of the whole universe. Even the earth, the moon and other planets revolve around the Sim in set orbits. Hence there is perfect beauty and harmony in nature. Discipline inculcates in us a sense of duty and obedience and is essential in all walks of life. The absence of discipline will lead to chaos and confusion. Home is the nursery of discipline. It must be inculcated early in life. However, a glimpse of the existing scenario reveals discipline is sadly lacking in all spheres of life. We hear of strikes and demonstrations in schools and colleges. Students boycott classes on trivial issues. Elections to students' unions have also ruined the healthy academic environment. Direct political interference has caused student strife, clashes and violence. The students forget that they come to educational institutions to study. They are easily misled and misguided by vested interests. Proper counselling and guidance by parents and teachers can help the students to maintain discipline.</p>

Write an article in about 150-200 words for your school magazine on the topic 'Value Education-a remedy for social evils&#8217;. You are Mohit/Mona.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VALUE EDUCATION-A REMEDY FOR SOCIAL EVILS</strong><br />
(by Mohit/Mona)</p>
<p>The present scenario of our country is not good. The newspapers carry accounts of thefts, murder, terrorist-attacks, robberies, rapes, dowry deaths etc. Modem youth are a disillusioned, depressed, disheartened lot. Unemployment scares them in face. There is an increase in the crime rate amongst the educated folk as well. Many social evils have crept in the society due to lack of moral education. Modem education is merely academic and there is no stress to uplift the students morally, spiritually and physically. Value-based education inculcates morals, ethical values, performance of duty, regard and consideration for fellow human beings, sympathy and compassion. Value education makes an individual responsible, sensitive and a decent human being. In short, value education can help in removing all social evils.</p>

The government has banned smoking in public places. Write an article on 'Hazards of Smoking' in about 150-200 words for your school magazine. You are Anu of XI A.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HAZARDS OF SMOKING</strong><br />
(by Anu-XI A)</p>
<p>It is a welcome step that the government has banned smoking in public places like railway station, bus terminus, parks, cinemas and social gathering. Smoking is injurious to health. It endangers our life and is a serious health hazard. Smoking is a very bad habit. Children take to it for fun in tender age and soon become addicts. One may start with a cigarette a day and end with a packet or two per day. Smoking causes great damage to our mind and body, heart and purse. A tobacco addict falls a prey to many ailments such as cough, cancer and heart ailments. Lungs and respiratory as well as circulatory systems get impaired. Even the digestion system is badly affected. Smoking is a slow poison which holds its victim in its clutches firmly. The sooner it is left, the better it will be and the best thing is not to start smoking.</p>

Delhi Administration has launched a campaign against use of crackers on the occasion of Diwali. Write an article on "Ban Crackers" in about 150-200 words for your school magazine. You are Dipti/Dhruva.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BAN CRACKERS</strong><br />
(by Dipti/Dhruva)</p>
<p>Many harmful practices have been associated with some of our religious festivals and social events. Bursting crackers on Diwali, weddings etc. is such an evil practice. It is not only wasteful but harmful as well. Perhaps the desire to display wealth and a misguided notion of fun urges people to enjoy the sight of their hard earned money going up in smoke.<br />
The smoke emitted by the firework releases harmful and poisonous gases. People suffering from asthma and other respiratory disorders have to bear additional suffering. The indulgence in this practice encourages the social evil of child labour. Most of the factories producing fire-crackers use children as labourers. These unfortunate children are deprived of education and healthy childhood. They also contact diseases by handling poisonous chemicals. Hence, it is the need of the hour to ban crackers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 21:</span></strong><br />
Delhi Administration has launched a campaign against use of polythene bags. Write an article on 'Hazards of Polythene Bags' in about 150-200 words for your school magazine. You are Swati/Sanjay.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HAZARDS OF POLYTHENE BAGS</strong><br />
(by Swati/Sanjay)</p>
<p>Polythene bags are a potential threat to our environment. They have many adverse effects on human health and hygiene. Polythene bags are non-biodegradable. They do not dissolve in mud. Rather they clog the pores and do not allow earth to suck up water. Thus the fertility power of the earth is lost. New buds do not get a chance to come up. Greenery is hampered. They produce obnoxious gases when burnt. These gases cause serious diseases like bronchitis, eyesore, rashes, allergy, cancer etc. Heaps of discarded polythene bags present an ugly sight. They scatter with wind and choke the drains. Deadly germs breed in the pools of dirty water. Sewer system is choked. Stray animals eat them and their digestive systems get disturbed. We should create public awareness against these hazards. Anti-polythene campaigns should be organised.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 22:</span></strong><br />
You are Priya/Piyush. You have noticed growing tendency towards violence among young people. Write an article for the school magazine in about 150-200 words highlighting the role of the media, viz the TV and the Cinema.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VIOLENCE AMONG YOUTH</strong><br />
(by Priya/Piyush)</p>
<p>Recently a very disturbing trend has been noticed in the behavioural pattern of the teenagers. It is the growing tendency towards violence among the youth. They have turned aggressive and assertive. They indulge in violent protests and loud outbursts of emotion. They take out processions and hold demonstrations at the slightest provocation. If opposed, they indulge in arson and looting. They take sinister delight in damaging public property. The tendency to vent their anger, show themselves off and impress others with their heroic feats forces them in off-beat activities. The media, viz the cable TV and the films with overdose of violence is largely responsible for fanning the tendency of violence among the young people. Lack of proper parental care and control and a desire to emulate their peers are other contributory factors. They should realize the difference between reel life and real life.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 23:</span></strong><br />
You are Rajat/Rajani. You have worked for Pulse Polio Campaign of Delhi. Write your experience of Health Care Schemes launched by the government. Write an article of about 150-200 words for a newspaper under "Health Column" discussing the need of a "Health Care Centre" in every locality.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEED OF HEALTH CARE CENTRES</strong><br />
(by Rajat/Rajani)</p>
<p>The government has launched many health care schemes for small-pox, tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV infections. The Pulse Polio campaign has been a resounding success. These efforts of the government are commendable but not sufficient. Recently, the city climes reported the re-emergence of some infectious diseases like cholera, small pox, malaria, dengue, etc. These were thought to be under control, but they have resurfaced. Cases of HIV infection have multiplied. Hence there is urgent need of a health care centre in every locality. These centres can check diseases by diagnosing them at early stages and providing effective cure. In short, health care centres are essential to ensure a disease-free nation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 24:</span></strong><br />
In a "Pollution-control awareness" drive launched by your school a student Kapil Mathur arrived at the conclusion that Delhi is the most polluted city of the world.

Delhi : The most polluted city of&#8230;<br />
Causes : No. of vehicles increasing.<br />
- increasing no. of industries emitting poisonous gases.<br />
- flow of waste into the water of the Yamuna.<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
- Check increasing carbonisation.<br />
- plant trees.<br />
- build mass public awareness.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DELHI-THE MOST POLLUTED CITY OF THE WORLD</strong><br />
(by Kapil Mathur)</p>
<p>Among the most polluted cities of the world, Delhi enjoys the dubious distinction of topping the list. It is not only the most polluted city in India, but the whole world. The reasons are quite obvious. Delhi has developed and expanded phenomenally. With the ever-increasing population, the number of vehicles plying on the road has also multiplied manifold. Growing number of industries emitting poisonous gases is another contributory factor for air- pollution and environmental degradation. The discharge of chemical waste into the Yamuna has polluted the water of the river. It is now unfit even for animals. Immediate steps should be taken to check carbonisation. Tree-plantation and preservation should be given top priority. Mass public awareness has to be built. The citizens should realize their responsibility in keeping Delhi neat and clean. Campaigns like 'Cleaner Delhi-Greener Delhi' have spread the message of keeping pollution under check. The efforts of MCD of collecting household waste in separate bins-biodegradable and non-biodegradable-can also decrease pollution. Let us all join hands to keep Delhi pollution free. Only then we can control the demon of pollution.</p>

You are Manish/Manisha. You went to a circus famous for its extraordinary animal shows. You saw people clapping and shouting with joy while applauding the tricks and feats performed by some of these wild animals. But you felt miserable to learn the cruel ways and methods used at the circus to make animals perform antics and dangerous feats. Your father showed you the pictures given below.<br />
Write an article in 150-200 words on the 'Plight of Circus Animals'.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PLIGHT OF CIRCUS ANIMALS</strong><br />
(by Manish /Manisha)</p>
<p>Animals were born free, but man has tamed them and uses them for his own benefit. Even the wild animals have not been spared. The more dangerous the animal, the more spectators it draws to the circus. So man uses these animals as an object of fun, diversion and merriment. In the world of public entertainment, circus occupies a prominent place. We feel thrilled to watch the antics of the lion, bear and elephants who dance to their ring master's tunes. The tricks and feats of these animals provide a sheer contrast to the adventurous feats of performing artistes. The children express their joy with clapping while the grown-ups just marvel at the dare devilry of the ring masters. People ignore hard and harsh facts. The bears, tigers, lions and elephants are caged, starved and lashed during the long period of their training. They are subjected to blood-chilling cruelty till they become tame, weak and obedient. Even their angry growls titillate people. The cruelty to animals should be stopped.</p>

Recently Govt, of NCT has banned the use of plastic bags in entire Delhi. But you see the use of plastic goods in every walk of life. Some of them are indicated below in the pictures.<br />
Think of the other uses of plastics in human life and write an article on the Role of Plastics in the Modem Age in about 150-200 words. You are Varsha/Vijay.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PLASTIC AND MODERN AGE</strong><br />
(by Varsha/Vijay)</p>
<p>Plastics are synthetic substances-polymers-produced by chemical reactions. They are mostly made from petroleum. Plastics are everywhere: the pipes that carry water to the fields to irrigate crops, bright light, handy and portable furniture, light weight but durable and unbreakable crockery are some of the items made of plastic. The soles of our shoes, the covers of machines and even their bodies and parts, e.g., the body of the camera, television, computer, washing machine, mixer-grinder etc. are made of various types of plastics. The steering wheel of your car, the mobile cell phone and even the ball-pen in your hand are made of polymers. Plastic has permeated deep into our lives. The high consumption of plastic has created the problem of solid waste. Recycling of plastic is highly polluting, that is why the carry bags of recycled plastics have been banned.<br />
Plastic is non-biodegradable. Burning of plastic releases toxic gases in the air. Plastic bags choke the drains and check flow of sewage system. Some hungry stray cows eat plastic carry bags and die. However, in spite of the dangers posed by low quality plastic bags, plastic goods are popular in almost every walk of life.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A COWARD TURNS A HERO</strong><br />
(by Pravesh /Preeti)</p>
<p>Aditya is well known as a chicken-hearted fellow. He is scared of even little insects, but the tension and fear of examination made him study till late at night. He kept his door a little ajar to go to his granny in the lobby. One night, he heard some heavy footsteps treading on the floor. He feared that some devil or ghost was about to devour him. So he switched off the light and hid<br />
himself under the bed. In the darkness a giant figure moved towards him. The newcomer was groping in the dark. Aditya was so terrified that his mouth was dry. He dare not utter a sound as it might reveal his presence. As the figure turned its back towards Aditya, he grabbed one of his legs with both hands and dug his teeth on his calf. The man shrieked in panic. Aditya's father and their servant rushed in with torch and sticks. The intruder was overpowered. The man was handed over to police. Later, Aditya was honoured for his "bravery as he had helped in nabbing a 'wanted' offender.</p>

You are Navin/Neha. You have just visited a glass factory which employs children and have witnessed the awful coi.dition of the boys and their place of work.

With the help of the sketches given below and your own ideas, write an article in about 150-200 words advocating a total ban on child labour.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BAN ON CHILD LABOUR</strong><br />
(by Navin/Neha)</p>
<p>Witnessing a factory which employs child labour is a nerve-racking experience. The other day I was shocked to see the plight of young boys working in a bangle factory in awful conditions. Their tired looks, haggard bodies, dirty and tom clothes, drooping eyes and blackened hands and faces revealed their misery. It clearly showed the height of exploitation motivated by greed. Child labour is also engaged in carpet-making, cracker industry, toy industry, brick-kilns and road side restaurants and as domestic help. Poverty, hunger and unemployment force the poor parents to get their wards employed anywhere provided he can bring money. Child-labour is cheap, docile and unorganised. They can be forced to work for longer hours. The government should take effective steps to stop this menace. The offenders must be awarded severe penalties and punishment. This will act as a deterrent for others also.</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PREVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION</strong><br />
(by Madhur/Madhuri)</p>
<p>Environmental degradation is a major problem for the modem city-dwellers. Unprecedented advance in industrialisation, mining and rapid urbanisation and increasing vehicles of transport caused a severe strain on the facilities. Emissions of poisonous and harmful gases, discharge of the effluents and industrial waste have destroyed the purity of air and water. Deforestation and arbitrary felling of trees have deprived mother earth of her lungs. City-dwellers have fallen prey to breathing disorders and chest-lung related diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and whooping cough. There is so much suspended particulate matter in the air that scooterists have to put on masks and carry oxygen inhalers. The black smoke emitted by the vehicles sends out clouds of smoke. We should take steps to prevent further environmental degradation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EVILS OF DOWRY SYSTEM</strong><br />
(by Shreya/Shirish)</p>
<p>Dowry which used to be a token of love and affection to a daughter at her wedding has now become a necessary evil in the modem materialistic age. Dowry has in fact assumed such a menacing proportion that the merit of the girl is secondary. The worth of a girl is measured in terms of the dowry she brings. All the laws and regulations such as equality of sexes, equal opportunities, respect for the girl child are thrown aside while negotiating a marriage deal. Many educated, talented and beautiful girls fall in the clutches of this demon. The greedy dowry seekers invent novel measures to seek and extract dowry. The incidents of bride burning Eire increasing day by day. Gender bias cannot be rooted out without eradicating social evils like dowry. There is no dearth of laws and regulations. Stringent action and deterrent punishment are needed. An awakened society of enlightened youth can help to curb the evils of dowry.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CORRUPTION-THE CANCER OF OUR SOCIETY</strong><br />
(by Arti Gupta)</p>
<p>Corruption has become the dangerous canker that has entered deep into all strata of our society. It has entrenched itself deeply in the social, political, economic and religious life of the nation. Even the persons in high places have been ensnared in the web of corruption. The names of former Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao are linked with scandals. It seems corruption has percolated from the top to the bottom. You pay the piper and call the tune. Files don't move in the offices until the wheels of illegal gratification pull them. Everything seems on sale. Top posts and jobs can be bought. Corrupt officers and businessmen are hand in glove with each other. Smuggling, hoarding, parallel black-marketing are the banes of corruption. If this virus of corruption is not eliminated now, it will wreck our social, economic and political fabric beyond redemption.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 8:</span></strong><br />
Smoking harms the smoker as well as the non-smoker. It should be banned in public places. Look at the picture given below and write your views on the subject in an article for publication in your school magazine. You are Vinay/Varsha. (Word limit: 150-200)<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BAN SMOKING</strong><br />
(by Vinay/Varsha)</p>
<p>The hazards of smoking are too grave to be dismissed lightly. Practically all mayor health disorders are caused by smoking as well as aggravated and made worse. High blood pressure, heart disorders and cancer are the major killer diseases caused by smoking. Doctors, health workers and societies engaged in social work are making all out efforts, worldwide to stop smoking. Banners, posters, placards and street plays proclaim loudly and clearly that each cigarette smoked reduces the smoker's life by a couple of minutes. Few people realise that non-smokers can also suffer from the diseases induced by smoking if they go on inhaling smoke from other people's smoking. These passive-smokers run a high risk of the incidence of these disease as they fail to take any precaution or remedial action. Our government should realise the harms of smoking and ban smoking in public places. Awareness, motivation and sense of responsibility on the part of smokers is needed to curtail smoking and avoid giving smoke to non-smokers.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 1:</span></strong><br />
In order to promote reading habits in the students, your school has organised a Library Week. You are Ranjan/Reena. You have to speak in the morning assembly and inform the students about the week-long programme. You have noted the following points:<br />
- days and dates<br />

Write your speech in 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LIBRARY WEEK</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal,-Vice-Principal, teachers and friends!<br />
It gives me great pleasure to speak to you about the Library Week that our school has organised from 2nd to 9th September this year. This week is slightly different from the others. Here we have to shift the focus to mental attainment. The aim of celebrating this week is to inculcate reading habits among students. Reading, you know makes a man perfect. So new arrivals in the reference section such as encyclopaedia and dictionaries as well as general books will be displayed. National Book Trust and Oxford University Press are putting up an exhibition. We have invited Dr Kailash Vajpayee to inaugurate the exhibition. He will autograph the books and interact with students. Other authors like Khushwant Singh and Ruskin Bond will also pay us a visit. During the week, a quiz competition will be organised. The Reading section will have more new magazines of teenagers' interest.<br />
I appeal to all of you to spend as much free time in the library as you can.<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:</span></strong><br />
You are Ankit/Ankita. You have to deliver a speech on the topic "Education Gives One Power". You have jotted down the following notes:<br />
Education trains mind-sharpens skill and abilities-Education: a source of power- improve self-be independent-earn money-ignorance to knowledge-removes superstition-develops a free spirit-important for women: gives them freedom from social ills-independent-responsible.<br />
Write your speech in 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EDUCATION GIVES POWER</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and friends!<br />
Education provides us knowledge. It trains our mind and sharpens our skills and abilities. Education refines our tastes and temperaments and builds our thought process. Vocational courses help young boys to earn and learn together. They provide means of earning livelihood and open the route to employment. Professional courses, as is evident from the name itself, equip us for adopting various professions. Some of these highly skilled professionals seek placements or jobs in esteemed companies and business concerns. Thus education is important for our survival. Decent living is impossible<br />
without good income or high salary. Education improves the quality of our life and frees us of superstition, foolish, meaningless mind-blocks and rituals. If women are educated the whole family benefits qs the food is hygienically prepared, children are healthy, well-mannered and disciplined. Education gives us power over our environment. We can control the situation and shape our destiny. Education spreads awareness among people and gives them freedom from social ills. It makes people independent by providing them means to learn their living. They become responsible citizens and realise their rights and duties. In short, education gives one power.<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 3:</span></strong><br />
You are Priya/Piyush. You are a member of the Environment Club of your school. After visiting many places you have realized that it is the need of the hour to protect environment. You decide to create awareness among the students. Write a speech in 150-200 words on 'Environmental protection' to be delivered in the morning assembly.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and friends!<br />
Global warming has accelerated the rise of temperature on earth. The sea level is also rising and glaciers' are melting away. Natural calamities are taking a toll of life on earth. Floods and scanty rainfall result in a crunch of food products, drinking water and disturb normal living conditions. The drought in Rajasthan has led to deaths and famine. Man is himself to blame for the deterioration of ecosystem. Depleting forests, industrial pollution, toxic-wastes, vehicular pollution, cutting of trees in cities, and lack of green cover are some of the contributory factors. The entire process of environmental pollution is becoming a vicious cycle. The urgent need of the hour is to protect environment. School children have begun to create awareness by compaigning against polythene bags and recycling waste material. Let us join hands to protect our forests, grow more trees, check toxic pollutants and change our lifestyle.<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 4:</span></strong><br />
You are Anshu/Anita. You have secured 95 per cent marks in English. Your English teacher has persuaded you to share the secret of your success with your schoolmates. You decide to deliver a speech 'English is an extremely scoring subject' in the morning assembly. Write the speech in about 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ENGLISH: EXTREMELY SCORING SUBJECT</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and friends!<br />
English is an extremely scoring, provided one follows a few rules, such as a good reading habit and the ability to be brief and specific in one's answers. As far as the lessons in the CBSE textbooks are concerned, a thorough reading is essential. Questions asked from these lessons can be from any part of the chapter/story and could be about any minute detail. Remember the complete name of main characters and the author's name. Your answer has to be in the same tense as the question. Secondly, the answer should be relevant and to the point. In order to get high marks in the comprehension passages and writing tasks, a student must have good communication skills as well as good reading habit. In article/report writing, questions on current affairs are often asked. Reading comes in very handy while writing such compositions. A report should always be written in the passive voice. In note-making, do not give more than five points. Give sub-points for each main point in a logical sequence. On the basis of the points,<br />
write a summary and give a title. In letter writing, be brief and accurate. Adopt the block format. Try to be creative while writing advertisements. The phrases/language should be catchy. These are*some points that may stand you in good stead.<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 5:</span></strong><br />
Manish has to speak in debate supporting the motion that life in the country (a village) is preferable to life in the city. Below you can see his notes. Use the information to develop Manish's speech in 150-200 words.<br />
COUNTRY (A VILLAGE) peace and quiet-soothing air-fresh and pure green fields all around-lovely sight helpful neighbours<br />
CITY<br />
vehicles-smoke<br />
industries-smoke-pollution<br />
crowded streets<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LIFE IN A COUNTRYSIDE PREFERABLE TO LIFE IN A CITY</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairperson, Members of faculty and dear Friends!<br />
I stand before you to support the motion that life in the country side is preferable to life in the city. At the outset I will like to remind the audience about the numerous advantages that the villages offer. In fact life in the country has so many advantages over life in the city that I don't think any one present would disagree with me. The atmosphere is peaceful and quiet and has a soothing effect. The air is fresh and pure. Green fields which can be seen all around are a lovely sight. In the country people are friendly and the neighbours are helpful. On the other hand, cities are full of vehicles giving out smoke and creating atmospheric pollution. There is also air pollution from the chimneys of industries spewing off smoke. Moreover, the streets in the city are always crowded with people. Everyone is in a hurry and never finds time to relax. Village life is tension free. There is no undue hurry and excitement. The villagers may be poor in terms of income but they live a far happier life than the city dwellers. Hence I conclude that life in the countryside is preferable to life in the city.<br />
Thank you.</p>

Arun Kumar is a resident of Kalkaji. He is an active member of citizens' forum. He is shocked to read the news that the Government has decided to increase the prices, of petroleum products with immediate effect. He wants to enlighten fellow citizens about the impact of Government decision on common man. Draft Arun's speech in about 150-200 words highlighting the impact of the hike in prices of petroleum products on the life of common man.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>IMPACT OF RISE IN PRICES OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairman and dear friends!<br />
The decision of the Central Government to hike the prices of Petroleum products has shocked all the consumers. The salaried classes and the middle-income group are the worst affected. As a common man, I resent this harsh decision of the government. The increase is not only sudden but steep also.<br />
The common man is already reeling under the spiralling prices. The recent hike in the cost of petroleum products will push the expenditure graph up by 30 to 40 per cent. The increase in the prices of diesel and petrol will not only increase the expenditure on one's own vehicle, but also increase the freight of goods and their initial cost will. The essential commodities will get dearer. Fares of buses, autos and taxis will have an upward swing. Shopkeepers will enhance the prices of even those articles which are produce locally. This sympathetic rise in prices of commodities will make it difficult to five within a fixed income. This escalation will mean cutting down the necessary expenditure by curbing some needs of the family.<br />
I urge the Finance Minister to reconsider the decision which is bound to hit hard millions of working classes and salaried people besides, creating a vicious circle of spiralling prices. It is earnestly hoped that my views will merit some consideration at the hands of the authorities.<br />
Thank you.</p>

You are Navneet, a member of school Literacy Club, which has organised literacy classes in villages and city slums under the adult education programme. Draft a speech in 150¬200 words highlighting the importance of educating the illiterates.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ADULT EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairperson, distinguished guest and dear friends!<br />
Education provides all round development of our personality-body, mind and soul. Unfortunately, a vast number of our population remain uneducated. The rate of school drop-outs is increasing fast. To overcome the ever increasing number of illiterates Adult Education programmes have been launched by the Ministry of Education. Many voluntary and social organisation have also come forward to render service.<br />
The National Literacy Mission is an organization engaged in Adult Education. It has helped to eradicate illiteracy in India to a great extent. School and college students can also help in the noble mission. They can offer voluntary service during their free period, that is, vacation. They can organize adult literacy classes in their streets or villages. It is hoped that these educated villagers will prove helped in the development of the nation. Education will give them awareness and knowledge. They will gain information, dignity and self-respect. They will become good citizens of the nation. They will become free from the social bondage, exploitation and humiliation. Education will not remain ornamental. It will become a part of their personality.<br />

Suresh has been asked to deliver a speech on &#8216;The Brain Drain Problem'. He has prepared the following notes. Use these notes together with your own ideas, write the speech in about 150-200 words.<br />
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE BRAIN-D1LJN PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and dear friends!<br />
The problem of brain-drain has assumed serious proportion in the last thirty years or so. The nation spends its hard earned meager resources on the education and training of its doctors, engineers, scientists, etc. But these highly talented and trained men and women of genius migrate to developed countries.<br />
They desert the ranks for the lure of money, better facilities and living conditions. Some of them get opportunities for fulfilment of their ambitions and development of personality as there is full scope for it. They enjoy unlimited freedom for experiments and research and fear no resources crunch.<br />
The parent countries become poorer by the depletion of resources as a result of migration of trained and talented persons. The migrants too feel maladjusted in the new country where they are considered second grade citizens. Living and working in an alien culture among foreigners, they find themselves cut off from their own social modes and customs. They do suffer emotional vacuum as the memories of friends and relatives in their country haunt their minds. India too has been facing this problem. We must take steps to ensure them better facilities, improved living conditions, freedom for experimentation and research. In addition to this, their talents must be utilised for proper work and their work must be given due recognition. These measures, if adopted seriously, can check the problem effectively.<br />

</span></strong>Himanshu, the secretary of School Red Cross Committee has been asked to deliver a speech in the morning assembly to encourage his schoolmates to join first-aid classes to be run by Indian Red Cross Society. He has jotted down the following notes. Use these notes together with your own ideas to write the speech in about 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF FIRST AID</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and friends!<br />
First Aid is of immense help in case of an emergency or accident when the victim is to be given immediate help before some qualified doctor arrives or the victim is shifted to some nearby clinic or hospital. The importance of first aid can be judged from the fact that many precious fives are saved because they had been administered proper first-aid before the patients received attention from a professional medical practitioner. The knowledge of first aid proves handy in a crisis. A person receiving bum injury, a victim of accident bleeding profusely, a drowned casualty or someone suffering from poisoning need urgent and immediate attention. Administration of immediate first aid provides the necessary relief till the case is attended by a competent doctor. Thus first aid can sometimes give a second life to a person. Hence it is always beneficial to get acquainted with the basic fundamentals of first aid.<br />
It is our moral duty to help the people in distress. But the aid rendered by an untrained person may sometimes prove harmful. Hence it is essential to have proper knowledge of first aid. Mere reading of books will not be sufficient. You must know the practical application too. Careful and correct use of first-aid can be beneficial as it can save precious human lives from the jaws of death. Hence I exhort my colleagues to get the requisite knowledge by joining first aid classes.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXAMINATIONS-TEST OF EFFICIENCY</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairperson, teachers and dear friends!<br />
Examinations are the tools in the hands of the teacher to assess the performance of the students. Tests provide information regarding the student's grasp of the subject as well as achievement. Like any other object, examination too, has two sides-the brighter side and the darker side. Let us concentrate on the positive aspects or the advantages of examinations.<br />
Examinations are essential at school and college level as they help to test the efficiency of the students. The promotion of the students to the next class depends on their qualifying the lower class. Thus the examinations provide the students a stimulus to work regularly and punctually. The annual examination is usually held at the end of the academic year, i.e., in March or April. The students know that they must cover their syllabus within the prescribed time-frame.<br />
Examinations provide a visible proof of the students grasp of knowledge and reproduction. Examinations inspire the sense of competition and increase the efficiency of the students. Regular examinations inculcate good values among students. They learn to become regular, systematic, methodical and punctual in their studies.<br />
Random or irregular testing is self-defeating because it tests the ignorance of the students rather than their knowledge. The students are caught unawares. Thus irregular tests should be discarded as a wastage of time and energy. They serve neither as a test of comprehension nor as test of achievement.<br />
These days it has become fashionable to talk about doing away with examinations altogether. If there were no examinations, the students would lose interest in studies and become non-serious. This "holiday from examinations" will promote idleness, carelessness and irresponsibly.<br />
Hence, to conclude, we must agree that objective periodic and regular testing is helpful to the student's as it ensures the real assessment of his worth and personality.<br />

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MISUSE OF SCIENTIFIC GADGETS</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairperson, teachers and students!<br />
Twentieth century has witnessed a revolution in the field of science and technology. Everyday we hear of numerous latest gadgets produced to make our life easy and comfortable.<br />
Recently, however, some cases have come to fight where criminals and unscrupulous elements have misused the gadgets of science for their selfish and refarious ends. Committing dacoity, kidnapping or murders using stolen vehicles has become a routine. Telephone is misused by anti-social elements.<br />
Young Romeos misuse the telephone for eve-teasing. Rash driving, honking of horns and playing loud music are some other tricks used by them.<br />
Unscrupulous operators of cable network screen vulgur films depicting glorification of violence and sex. These films directly encourage evils like smuggling, drinking and drugs. The hard-core terrorists use bombs hidden in toys to hit their targets. Remote control comes handy to them to accomplish their plan. The powerful beams of lasers are used by modem day criminals to break the safest safe.<br />
The remedy does not fie in banning the gadgets, but in arousing public consciousness. Police and administration must exercise effective vigilance. Law enforcement should be strict and law-breakers be given exemplary punishment.<br />

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE GENERATION GAP IS DESTROYING FAMILY LIFE</strong></p>
<p>Respected chairman, honourable judges, members of the staff and my dear Mends!<br />
I stand before you to speak my mind on "The Generation Gap is destroying family life'. There are many points to support this contention.<br />
The generation gap has caused à chasm between the old and the young. There is a clash of ideas and ideals, tastes, way of thinking and life-style. The young hanker after luxury, comfort and material happiness. They believe in full enjoyment and complete freedom. The elders insist on moral and spiritual values. They advocate renunciation and control on desires. The children think that their parents are slave to customs. The generation gap is evident in behaviour and manners of the two classes. The elders believe in strict obedience to a superior authority. They want that children must respect their elders and learn to be polite. The children pine for freedom. They resent all sorts of curbs. They demand freedom of expression. They want to have a say in family affairs. They insist that their views must be given proper consideration. This leads to bickerings, heart-burning and tension in the family.<br />
The elders insist on discipline and strict compliance of their orders. They advocate smiling acceptance of punishment meted out for breach of discipline. The young insist on unrestrained freedom and frankness. They advocate freedom of self-expression and are unwilling to tolerate any interference in their personal affairs-career, love-affair or marriage. Thus there is a wide gap between the two generations. This difference in their way of thinking and behaviour is destroying family life.<br />
Hence, I conclude that 'The generation gap is destroying family life'.<br />

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MODERN GADGETS HAVE MADE US SLAVE TO MACHINES</strong></p>
<p>Respected chairperson, honourable judges, members of the staff and my dear Mends! Today I stand before you stoutly and wholeheartedly to speak on 'Modem gadgets have made us slave to machines'. We have become so dependent upon machines for everything that out life would come to a stand still without them.<br />
Science and technology have transformed the life style of modem man. In fact the modem civilization has become highly mechanised. Right from the time we get up to the time we go to bed we depend on one or the other modem scientific gadget. He uses fridge to store food and keep it cool. Fans, room coolers and air conditioners keep him cool. Telephone increases the range of his voice whereas car multiplies the speed of his legs and now he can fly even like a bird. In his office too he dictates letters on dictaphone, which his secretary types on a typewriter, another device of modem science. Now he can store information in a computer. Mobile phones, television and cable network have become quite common. Most of these gadgets are based on electricity.<br />
Now think of a day when electricity fails. All the activities of the morning are shelved or delayed. There is no hot water for shaving or bathing. No tea or sandwich for<br />
breakfast. No computer, television or airconditioner can work without electricity. We feel miserable because we have become so used to them.<br />
The modem gadgets have helped the world to leap forward to a glittering civilization. They have provided tremendous power and unlimited knowledge to man. In fact the modem gadgets have revolutionised every phase of man's life. Man has become so dependent upon them that it is impossible to conceive of modem man's life without these gadgets. Hence, we can safely conclude that modem gadgets have made us slaves to machines.<br />

Based on this table and using your own ideas write out Shruti's speech in about 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ILLITERACY IN INDIA</strong></p>
<p>Respected members of the faculty and dear friends.<br />
It is indeed shocking that even after more than five decades of independence, we have failed to spread the fruit of literacy among the masses. It is most unfortunate that even today almost half the population of India is illiterate.<br />
It is disheartening to note that in the last thirty years the literate population has risen by a mere three thousand lakhs and in the last fifty years the literacy rate has gone up by 38 per cent. Since the population of the country is increasing fast, we have to take immediate and urgent steps to spread the fruits of literacy among the masses. The lamp of knowledge should be taken to the farthest nook and comer of the far flung villages as well as the nearby slums.<br />
Let us not lose our patience while engaged in the noble task of spreading literacy. Let us adopt literacy as a mission and as our obligation towards society and the nation. The students of schools can play a very effective and constructive role in educating the illiterates. "Each one teach one' should not remain a mere slogan. It should be translated into reality. The young students should come forward and accept it as a challenge.<br />
I therefore call upon each one of you to take a solemn pledge to educate at least one illiterate per year. I hope that all of you will rise to the occasion and take up cudgels to remove the blot of illiteracy from the fair name of our nation.<br />
Thank you.</p>

</span></strong>Harsh is deeply upset to read a report of death of people in thousands due to hunger and homelessness. He wonders why these homeless persons couldn't be provided shelter at night in educational institutions and places of worship. Harsh decides to deliver a Speech in the morning assembly to motivate the students, teachers and Principal to take pity on the plight of the homeless and provide them night shelter. Write his speech in 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SHELTER TO HOMELESS</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and dear friends!<br />
I invite your attention to a social cause. Every year thousands of homeless people die of extreme cold. It is the responsibility of the state and the citizens to provide facilities to houseless persons to sleep indoors during chilly weather.<br />
Since creating new shelters is both time-consuming and costly, we must find enough shelters for homeless people in all our cities from the existing stock of buildings. A large number of spacious buildings at prime locations are vacated every night. These are schools, colleges, offices and places of worship that lie empty every night. There is no reason why these buildings can't be additionally redeployed with small modifications as night shelters for. the homeless.<br />
You may ask why school and college premises should be deployed additionally as shelters at night. It is not just that most school and college teaching spaces are vacant during night and the same space can be used by dispossessed people who do not have a place to sleep, without any-extra cost. Far more important is the fact, that this step would provide these educational institutions an opportunity to fulfil their social commitments as responsible social institutions and teach children and young people first-hand social empathy and social responsibility.<br />
I do hope that the authorities of our school would realize the plight of these homeless persons and open the doors of our schools to them at night. It will show fight to the entire country.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WATER-BORNE DISEASES-A THREAT</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, distinguished guests, teachers and friends!<br />
The report published in the newspaper is shocking. It brings to the fore the callous attitude of the administration. It is a total failure of the Water-Board to provide clean, safe water to the people, a basic necessity. The report categorically says that this water is unfit for human consumption.<br />
What are we going to do about this? Are we going to get together and fight or let water-borne diseases like cholera, hepatitis and typhoid spread? Contaminated water can cause these deadly diseases which can cause large scale deaths, if not treated immediately. These water samples must be shown to the Municipal Commissioner and an explanation demanded. On the one hand, we celebrate World Health Day, on the other hand, the basic commodity-water-is impure, I'm sure the concerned authorities will look into the matter and ensure clean and safe drinking water for the public.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>POLLUTION CAUSED BY FIRE-CRACKERS</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and dear friends!<br />
Good Morning! Today I would like to talk about a subject that we all do know but scarcely pay any heed to it. On the days of festivals most of us burst fire crackers not realizing the amount of pollution they cause. Thus we are ourselves degrading the environment. The bursting of fire crackers increases atmospheric pollution. The suspended particulate matter like nitrogen oxide and sulphur dioxide are added up when a cracker is burst.<br />
The increase in atmospheric pollution gives rise to respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis. The cases of heart-attacks and strokes multiply. The noise pollution created by bursting of crackers may cause deafness as well.<br />
We may enjoy the bright light and the sound of explosion for a few seconds, but we ignore the permanent damage caused by bursting of crackers. We ourselves inhale the extremely harmful particles as we ignite the crackers.<br />
Hence it becomes the duty of each one of us to keep our environment clean and refrain from bursting crackers. Let us put an end to this wasteful exercise of burning our hard- earned money.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>POLLUTION BY PLASTIC BAGS</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and dear friends!<br />
Good morning to you all! While going through the morning newspaper today, I came across two photo advertisements. These highlight the major problem created by the steady use of harmful polybags made of recycled plastic. The government agencies as well as voluntary organizations have made a number of efforts to propagate the harmful effects of plastic bags. However, it seems that habit die hard.<br />
Most of us still prefer to ignore the gravity of using plastic bags. Advertisements, it is said, are far more effective than the written speech. One of the advertisements reads "Kill the plastic bag before it kills your future." It strikes the nail on the head. It clearly indicates the extreme harmfulness of these plastic bags. Let me elaborate the point further. The plastic bags are made of harmful and toxic chemicals that contaminate the environment. The things that we keep inside them become unhealthy. A single plastic bag is enough to choke the whole drainage system. If these bags are discarded carelessly, some animal may eat them. These get stuck in their bodies. A little effort and awareness on our part now can save us from a lot of future problems. Let us start using cloth or gunny bags and completely boycott the use of plastic bags. Once we revert to the old cloth/gunny bags we can convince the shopkeepers not to use plastic bags. This step will enable us to keep our environment clean, green and healthy.<br />

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VANA MAHOTSAVA DAY</strong></p>
<p>Respected teachers and dear friends!<br />
It is good that our school is celebrating the Vana Mahotsava Day. It is only recently that man has realized the importance of afforestation and growing more trees. In these days of ever increasing pollution, trees are the best friends of human beings.<br />
The importance of planting more and more tree lies in the fact that the number of trees preserved is quite low as compared to the number of trees planted. Some of the trees wither away due to lack of proper nourishment and care and some are cut down. Two random examples are sufficient to prove the point. The number of trees planted in 2003 was 4000. Of these more than 1000 dried (withered) of the old trees about 2500 were cut. Thus the loss of trees was just 500 less than the plantation that year. However, due to preservation of the old trees the number of preserved trees stood around 1500. Let us consider another example. The highest number of trees 8000, were planted in the year 2007. But in the same year 3000 trees withered and 5000 were cut. Only 4000 trees survived. These figures clearly indicate that the loss of trees due to cutting or withering is almost equal to fresh plantation. This is not a healthy sign. Hence our endeavour should be not only to plant more and more trees every year, but also to preserve them in greater number. Proper care and nourishment is as necessary for trees as for children. Let us look after these tender saplings as we look after our young brothers and sister and guard them from every danger-natural or man-made.<br />
I am confident that the willing co-operation of all my young friends will certainly make this programme highly successful.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NATIONAL LITERACY DAY</strong></p>
<p>Respected teachers and dear friends!<br />
The population of our country is increasing at a tremendous speed and along with it the number of illiterates, especially in the rural areas, is shooting up. This tendency is a cause of concern for all the enlightened citizens who are busy in developmental activities or welfare programmes.<br />
Knowledge or education makes a person civilized, cultured and self-dependent. Education is a medium to transmit knowledge from one person to another over time and space. Today the world is on the threshold of a revolution. National boundaries are breaking up and the nations of the world are coming closer. The world is becoming well-knit. The rich and developed countries are making rapid advances due to their advanced science and technology. The poor and undeveloped countries are lagging behind in this race of progress simply because their people are illiterates and uneducated. In order to convey one's thoughts and feelings and to understand others, education is essential. Literacy is the first step in this direction.<br />
Poverty and lack of opportunity have hindered majority of poor persons from attaining formal education. The percentage of illiterates is far higher than that of matriculates or graduates. Concerted efforts have been made during the last twenty-five years to take the lamp of knowledge to every nook and comer under the National Literacy mission. School teachers, students, social workers and voluntary agencies have come forward to lend a helping hand in this noble mission. The Government of India has<br />
launched Adult Education Programmes. With the constant efforts of dedicated workers the pace of literacy has picked up. Students have adoped the slogan 'Each one, teach one' in its real meaning. "</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HIKE IN PRICES OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairperson and dear friends!<br />
The cartoon given above reveals the cartoonist's sense of humour at the recent hike in the prices of petroleum products. These prices are a gift of the new government to the already over-burdened common man. Though the price-rise varies from ₹ 2 per litre in case of petrol to ₹ 1.50 per litre of diesel, the consumers are adversely affected both directly as well as indirectly. The rise in the prices of diesel will lead to a hike in the bus fares and freight of goods. Everyday consumable articles will become costlier. The hike in LPG prices is enough to raise the ire of the harassed housewife who doesn&#8217;t know how to balance her meagre budget against this onslaught.<br />
In fact, the effects of price-hike will percolate to all sections of society-commuters, transporters, farmers, traders, consumers, etc. Increase in cost of tariff will make goods dearer and people will face the shortage of essential items or they will have to shell out more. This will indirectly boost hoarding and black-marketing. Corruption and black money will increase and the means of the common man will shrink.<br />
The government must reconsider this hike and roll back the increase on LPG and diesel. No one will protest if more tax is levied on luxury items such as big cars, air conditioners, super computers, air-travel, etc. Frequent rise in prices is not good governance.<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 22:<br />
</span></strong>You are Shishir/Swati. Write a speech to be delivered at the morning assembly in your school about the increase in violence and social unrest in your area, interpreting the data given below. Also give, suggestions to curb them.    (Word limit-. 200)<br />
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INCREASE IN VIOLENCE AND SOCIAL UNREST</strong></p>
<p>Respected Principal, teachers and students!<br />
During the first decade of the millennium a disturbing trend was noticed in the society. The peace loving citizens of locality were rocked by a spurt in cases of violence and social unrest. A close scrutiny of the 'Violence' graph reveals a hundred per cent increase during the year 2003-2004. The upward swing went on mounting higher steadily during the next year and showed no sign of abatement. It stuck to a steady level during 2006 as well. Perhaps it was due to some strict measures adopted by the law enforcing agencies. It might also be the proverbial lull before the storm as the violence graph touched the peak in 2007 and maintained the same level during 2008.<br />
Violence against women and misbehaviour with them are manifestations of sexstarved male chauvinism to assert their Supermacy and dominance. The elimination of potential rivals during elections is the bane of politics. Apart from these murders or those committed by extremists to cause panic or by hardened criminals for extortions at the behest of their masters. The net result is the same heinous extermination of a particular individual/ group or section of society.<br />
It is high time urgent steps were undertaken by the state as well as society to curb anti-social elements as well as propagators of violence. Deterrent punishment and speedy disposal of cases can be an effective curb on the nefarious designs of these offenders against state and society.<br />
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 23:<br />

(Word limit: 200)<br />
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>IMPORTANCE OF TOURISM</strong></p>
<p>Respected Chairperson and distinguished guests!<br />
Tourism is a thriving business for earning valuable foreign exchange as well as providing an opportunity for cultural exchange and generating employment. India has a rich heritage of art, sculpture, music, dance and drama. Many European countries have promoted tourism as a trade. In some countries it is run like an industry. We, in India, are running it in a non-professional or amateurish manner as is evident from the troughs is the graph of domestic as well as foreign tourists.<br />
It is high time we regarded travel and tourism as an industry and launched action plans to accelerate the growth of tourism. A nodal financial institution catering to the specific needs of tourism industry should be established.<br />
The main stumbling blocks in the development of tourism at present are lack of infrastructure, inadequate ways of reaching hotels, tourist sites, gateways, etc., paucity in the number of coaches and cars (specially air-conditioned ones), ill-maintained roads. Conferences, cultured exchanges, tourism exchanges, leisure trips, education trips, holiday trips or business trips should be segregated and facilities available be publicized as an attractive package.<br />
The need and aspirations of the various categories of tourists should be carefully analysed and adhered to in the sphere of accommodation, food, entertainment and guided tours. Last but not the least the hotel industry should adopt a business like attitude in greeting and sending off the visitors with a smile. Give them a pleasant experience and prepare them to undertake a repeat visit soon.<br />
Thank you.</p>

A state of disorder and confusion was witnessed at almost all the bus stops whereas the situation was quite chaotic at the railway stations and ISBT. This was a direct outcome of the protest by bus operators against the Delhi Govt, orders to ban diesel driven buses with immediate effect. According to the Supreme Court orders only CNG fuel driven buses could operate after 1st October. The bus-operators pointed out that conversion to CNG mode was costly and refuelling was time consuming. So they called for a flash-strike to register their grievances. Their action brought transport to a standstill. School children, office-goers, patients, old and sick-persons were all stranded. There were not enough vehicles on the road to cope with the rush. Taxis and auto rickshaws had a field day. The plight of women and children was touching. Some alternative fuel or energy source is needed to save the transport going into a mess.</p>

It was a unique event in the history of the Lucknow University when angry, slogan-shouting students proceeded to the Vice-Chancellor's office from all sides.

While the youth raised slogans and waved placards, the police resisted their attempts to break the cordon and rush into the Senate hall, where a meeting of the Executive Council was going on. The shouts of "revoke the enhanced fee", reverberated in the air. Ultimately, the Registrar came out and asked the agitated students to submit their case in writing. The students felt pacified as he assumed them that the E.C. will consider their demands. The students presented a charter of demands, dropped their demonstration and went back to their classes.</p>

In the first two days of the week-long campaign, over three hundred violations have been booked for various offences. Maximum offences were of lane breaking. These violations were detected using special devices with the electronic eye fitted strategically. Jumping red-lights and breaking speed limits are next in frequency. These violations are reported to cause accidents with pedestrians and cyclists. High on the list of offences is rash driving by under-age drivers, some of whom sit behind the steering wheels without a driving licence. It will be better if the &#8220;Traffic Week' is preceded by an 'Awareness Week'.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 22:<br />
</span></strong>You are a press reporter. Recently Delhi reeled under a heavy fog for 22 days. This resulted in cancellation of many trains and air-flights. Passengers were stranded at the Palam Airport and Indira Gandhi Airport. Write a report in 150-200 words highlighting the plight of the stranded passengers.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PLIGHT OF STRANDED PASSENGERS</strong><br />
[Mukul, Staff Correspondent, The Indian Express]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">New Delhi: Jen. 21, 20XX<br />
The weather gods have been fickle and unpredictable and the forecasts of the weathermen ominously correct. What surprised everyone is the long spell of fogs and low temperature<br />
for more than 20 days. The thick fog delayed air flights and fast running trains. Passengers who had booked their seats in advance reported at the airport in time. They were not allowed to leave the hall. An announcement was made from time to time that the flight had to be rescheduled. Gradually, the number of passengers increased and the information network failed. The harassed persons could not contact their dear ones as the STD booths were not functioning. The stalls selling tea/coffee and snacks had already exhausted their supplies. Poor visibility and extreme cold made it difficult for people to move out. They remained cramped and stranded in the overcrowded waiting hall. What an ordeal for the air-travellers!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 23:<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RIOTING BY INDUSTRIAL WORKERS</strong><br />
[Akanksha, Staff Correspondent, TOI]</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">New Delhi: 6 April, 20XX<br />
Three buses were burnt and five were damaged by a stone throwing and road-blocking mob of agitated industrial workers. They felt provoked by the government decision to shift polluting industries out of residential areas to far flung places in outer Delhi or even out of Delhi. They felt cheated as they would be deprived of their jobs which was their sole means of subsistence. Hence they decided to lodge a protest in their own way. The protesters organised a demonstration and raised slogans. Flared up by the speeches of labour leaders, the peaceful march took a violent turn. Now the protesters came on roads and blocked traffic. Some mischievous elements destroyed government property. Schools were closed and markets forced to close. The commuters were stranded at various places. Till evening no settlement of dispute was in sight.</p>

<p>Yesterday a very devastating fire broke out in Uphar Cinema, New Delhi, taking a toll of 156 lives. The show was running on when the fire started at about 2 p.m. in the afternoon. On seeing the smoke and suffocation the firemen gave alarm but there was pitch dark in the hall. Audience started running one after the other for safety. More than 100 people got serious injuries. As the fire spread like a wild fire, the hall was completely burnt. Its roof fell flat with a crackling sound. More people could not be rescued by the fire brigade due to congestion in the hall and the area. The police reached in time and registered a case of gas leakage in the canteen. The canteen manager was arrested and taken into police custody. The city government has initiated an inquiry into this heinous act.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>KIDNAPPING BID FOILED</strong><br />
[XYZ, News Correspondent, The Express]</p>
<p>An attempt to kidnap an eight year old boy, Asim, was foiled by the timely intervention of East Delhi police on Friday. Asim was going to his teacher's house in the Saraswati Vihar at about 4.30 p.m. on Friday when he was whisked away by a red Maruti car. Many passers-by shut their eyes to the cruel, unjust and wicked act. But Munish Kumar, a young man noted the van number and informed the Police Control Room. The police at once swung into action and nabbed the kidnapper. The child was rescued and restored to his parents. The kidnapper, it was learnt, was a former employee of Asim's father and wanted to kidnap him for ransom. He is now languishing in police custody. The courage, nobility and sense of responsibility displayed by Munish Kumar is a fine example for others to emulate.</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DEVASTATION BY FLOODS</strong><br />
[XYZ, News Correspondent, The Express]</p>
<p>A visit to the flood-hit districts of the state of Orissa fills one with depressing thoughts. How can nature be so cruel? The cyclonic storm has proved a disaster for the state. Coastal areas have been .hit hard. The villages and hamlets have been adversely affected. Thousands of acres of land having crops are still submerged in water. Millions of cattle have been washed away or perished in the flood waters. Thousands of the villagers have been rendered homeless. Hundreds of children and the aged have been swept off. Thus there has been an all round destruction of life, property, cattle and crops. Government agencies and voluntary groups have rushed to the help of the flood- affected victims. The situation is grim and calls for more concerted efforts.</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>TRAVELLING WITHOUT A TICKET</strong><br />
[Arun, XI A]</p>
<p>Last month I had to go to Delhi by train suddenly at a very short notice. It was an experience which I do not wish to repeat ever. It caused me great embarrassment.<br />
I received a telephonic message that my friend had been seriously injured and was lying in R.M.L. Hospital, Delhi in a critical stage. I at once rushed to the Railway station. An express train was just leaving for Delhi. In my anxiety to be beside my Mend, I forgot that I hadn't purchased a ticket. The fact dawned on me as a ticket checker entered our compartment. I related the circumstances, but he wouldn't believe my story. Other passengers made funny remarks and gestures at my discomfiture. I had to pay a hefty fine as well as fare from Aligarh, the last stop.<br />
The incident left a deep impression on my mind. It still haunts me when I sits alone. I shudder to think how unfeeling and apathetic human beings can be to the plight of others.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:<br />
</span></strong>You were one of the passengers of an ill-fated plane that was hijacked by the terrorists. Sum up your experience and the main incidents before you were released. You may use 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HIJACKED IN AIR</strong><br />
[Archana, XI A]</p>
<p>Amritsar, 1 January 20XX<br />
I was one of the passengers on Delhi bound IA-814 plane. It was a fine, cool December evening. The sky was cloudless. It was about 5.30 p.m. on 28th December. Suddenly we heard a gruff loud voice. It asked the passengers to stay still. The air-hostesses turned pale with fear. The male crew appeared clueless. Gradually, the truth dawned on me. The plane had been hijacked by the terrorists. I felt tense and helpless. The terrorists directed the captain to divert the flight to Lahore and then to Kandhar. We were held as pawns. The hijackers demanded the release of five hard-core terrorists and ransom in crores. They threatened to gun down the passengers. We had a harrowing experience. We had to keep our head between our knees. None dared to open his mouth. One youngman who dared to enter into argument was murdered brutally. This frightened us all. The atmosphere of tension, trouble and harassment prevailed for five days. Somehow, the hard hearted terrorists softened a bit. They released women and children. Being a girl, I was one of the persons to be let off and allowed to go to the airport building. Later on I learnt that male passengers were put to trouble before the demands of the terrorists were fulfilled. This experience left a permanent scar on my heart.</p>

<p>Sixteenth August was a grand occasion for our family. My grandmother had turned eighty that day. We organised a family get-together. Messages had been sent to all my uncles, aunts and cousins. The ancestral home was decorated with flowers. A puja was performed in the temple. Then the main function began in the sitting room. It was a very cheerful occasion. All my uncles, aunts and cousins gathered under one roof. She was seated in a high arm chair. My uncle honoured her with a beautiful shawl. Then my parents presented her an almond coloured silk saree. Then came the turn of youngsters. She appreciated all the gifts presented to her and blessed us. She is still smart, witty and energetic. Words of wit and wisdom dropped like honey from her lips. Dressed in her usual orange coloured dress, she appeared like a divine personality.

[Sumit, XI B]</p>
<p>It was 27th July. I was returning home after a hot humid day. Suddenly the weather turned cloudy. Soon it began to drizzle. I had no umbrella, as it was clear in the morning. I continued walking. Soon the drizzle changed into heavy showers. There was no shelter available. I had no option but to walk back home in the rain. I had no respite. The rain gained in intensity. Soon strong winds began to blow. I hoped that it would lessen the fury of rain gods and the sky would become clear. I prayed to god to rescue me in this hour of distress. I was shocked to find that the sky had turned darker and gloomier and it was raining so hard and in big drops as if a cloud had burst on me. I was shaken to the spine, still I did not lose faith in my self. Myself confidence enlivened my spirits and I decided to continue walking. By the time I reached home, I was thoroughly drenched. I was shivering with cold. I was confined to bed for four days. I had to swallow bitter pills and stay in bed.</p>

<p>Our school recently conducted a charity show in aid of the flood-affected people of Andhra.

We the students, realised our responsibility and resolved to help the unfortunate victims of the vagaries of nature. We presented a gala variety entertainment programme in the townhall at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday evening. The entry was by donor cards only. The response from parents and patrons was overwhelming. The hall was full when the curtain was raised and our school choir presented a welcome song. Then I addressed the audience and explained the purpose of holding this show. This brief speech was followed by a variety of entertainment programmes. The clappings at the end of each item showed that the audience liked it. Then our Principal made a fervant appeal to the public to donate generously to help the victims of nature.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW I CELEBRATED MY BIRTHDAY</strong><br />
[by XYZ]</p>
<p>My birthday falls on the 4th April. This year too it was a gala event. Grandpa had arranged a 'havan'. The priests offered religious worship to the family gods and prayed for my long life. At 6 in the evening I welcomed my friends and relatives at the Gaylord's. They greeted me with the words "Many happy returns of the day!" They also gave me birthday presents. As I cut the cake all the invitees sang in a chorus: "Happy birthday to you." I offered them pieces of cake. Then dainty dishes and tea were served. It was followed by a brief but entertaining cultured programme. We had a jolly good time. I thanked all my friends and relatives for their kind visit and good wishes. Thus my birthday was celebrated in both the ways-traditional as well as modem. I sought the blessings of family gods and elders. I also enjoyed the fun of dancing and singing with my peers. At the end of the day, I was dead tired. So I retired to bed early. I had only one regret-Birthday come only once a year.</p>

All of them seemed glorious in their splendid dresses. One of them had dressed as Lord Shiva, the "Nataraj'. A girl had dressed herself as a reaper. A boy had come dressed as a juggler and displayed breathtaking feats. People felt amazed and clapped. Then came my turn. I had dressed myself as an old beggar. As I stepped down from the stage and went towards the chief guest with piteous looks and hand spread out for alms, the spectators stood up. My gestures and movements had so moved them that they offered me coins. My item was a huge success and I was awarded the first prize.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BURGLARY IN LOCALITY</strong><br />
[by Vijay]</p>
<p>I was studying in my room when at 11 p.m. I heard some agonising cries from the flat opposite my house. I saw two persons manhandling an old lady who seemed to be the sole occupant of the house. These burglars gagged her and tied her to a pillar. Then they ransacked the rooms. Meanwhile, I contacted the police station and gave brief</p>
<p>description of their physique and clothes as well as their activities. I also informed the police the exact location of the building and the flat of the victim. I was assured that the police would reach the scene of action immediately. Meanwhile, I felt highly agitated and disturbed. I roused the whole household. My mother advised me not to be foolhardy to attack the burglars with my stick. They might be carrying fire-arms. We should exercise caution and prevent the nefarious designs of the burglars. My elder brother found some fire-crackers. He fit them and threw then out of the window. They exploded with loud sound. The two burglars who had already ransacked the rooms felt scared and fled away from the scene. Their luck had, however, run short. The police party who lay in wait nabbed them and put them behind bars.</p>

[by XYZ]</p>
<p>It was a bright sunny Sunday morning in November. We left for Badkhal Lake for a picnic in a chartered bus alongwith our class-teacher. The journey took us half an hour. As soon as we crossed the Delhi Border at Badarpur, cool November wind greeted us. When we reached the lawns near the lake, we found the place quite overcrowded. Children and youngsters had come in glittering and colourful dresses. We selected a shady comer and sat there. We decided to play some amusing group games. Every one had to entertain others at his turn. We all sang and danced for hours together. Some of us could not resist the temptation of having a dip in the lake. Some others enjoyed boating under the supervision of the boating instructors. Some of us enjoyed swimming in the lake. I was scared of the deep waters. So I confined my aquatic activities to the shallow water near the bank of the lake. By 1 p.m. we felt hungry. We enjoyed the food we had brought. Them we rested for a while under the trees and listened to recorded music. It was 3 p.m. We divided ourselves in groups and enjoyed playing outdoor games. After playing hide-and- seek for an hour we left the place. It was indeed a great fun.</p>

Suddenly a motorcyclist came towards the shelter for passengers. The youngman slowed down his mobike near a young lady. In a twinkle of eyelid he snatched her necklace and purse and rode away fast. The screams of the young lady attracted the attention of others. I had scribbled the registration number of the vehicle. Meanwhile a Police mobile van arrived there. The young lady kept on crying and shedding tears. Some elderly gentlemen narrated the scene in brief. Then the inspector asked us about the registration number of the vehicle and the identity of the motorcyclist. I at once handed over the registration number of the motor cycle. The police inspector congratulated me on my alertness. He patted me on the back and asked me to describe the clothes, physical appearance and manners of chain-snatcher. I gave as detailed and graphic description as I could. The inspector flashed the details over wireless. The chain-snatcher was nabbed and taken to police station. All praised me for my alertness.</p>

<p>Last week my class teacher gave me a new assignment. I was entrusted the responsibility to write the final examination of class XII for a blind candidate. It was a challenging task as I had to read the questions to him and write the answers he dictated. My doubts and fears subsided as the blind boy listened patiently and calmly. Then he dictated the answers correctly and precisely. It seemed that his knowledge was immense. As I went on writing the answers, I could not help marvelling at his remarkable ability. What perseverance he had! How patiently he must have studied! He must have studied thoroughly and devoted a lot of time. What perseverance, what dedication to knowledge he exhibited! I was thrilled that I was contributing to his progress. It was a rewarding experience. I enjoyed the unique satisfaction of doing something worthwhile.</p>

<p>I did not know doom's day was minutes away as I settled down in front of the TV. Suddenly the window panes rattled and cracked. The fans started swaying. I understood that an earthquake had rocked the city. I shouted to everyone to rush to the open. The shaking was so violent that I could not stand upright. There was a loud sound of crash-of a massive crack. My sister picked up her baby and its milk bottle. I grabbed her hand and helped mother rise. Father had already opened the front door. Within seconds, the staircase had become overcrowded. We rushed in our slippers. Some of our neighbours were barefeet. On reaching the ground, my sister wondered if she had switched off the gas. There was no time to go back and check. Another jolt and the building crashed like a pack of cards. We had a horrible experience as we had been rendered homeless in five minutes.</p>

<p>My pet Roxy is six month old. It is white, fluffy and playful. Sometimes it wanders onto the road. Yesterday it was hit by a speeding scooterist-some youngman in hurry- some rash teenager of our colony. Roxy barked and collapsed. For a moment he was absolutely still. His eyes showed pain. He looked expectantly towards me. I touched his legs and found one of his legs broken. I at once swung into action. I put Roxy on a hardboard and gave him a pain killing tablet. Then I took him to a vet. He examined Roxy and put the broken leg in plaster. My worry was over as Roxy had been well taken care of. However, I couldn't help feeling sorry for young Roxy-he would have to move on three legs for a month! Poor Chap!</p>

[by XYZ]</p>
<p>It was the 7th March when I was busy poring over my notes and preparing for the next day's Maths paper-the toughest nut to crack. I was confronted with certain problems whose solutions eluded me. I was thinking of contacting my chum, Ritu, when the front-door bell rang. I opened the door to see my aunt and her two sons. I informed them of my parents' absence. Aunt decided to wait. Now I had no option but to entertain the guests. I went into the kitchen and found some ready-made snacks. Now I had to make intelligent conversation with my aunt. It proved to be nerve-wrecking because she knew nothing about computers, cricket or western pop-music and I did not know anything about the scriptures, Hindi-films or film stars. Time seemed to move at snail's pace. Fortunately, my parents arrived and I felt a sigh of relief.</p>

The enquiry clerk seemed very busy. The coolies were carrying luggage to the platform. The railway platform presented an interesting, amusing and absorbing scene. The hawkers were having a good time. People were anxiously waiting for the train. The scene changed as soon as the train arrived. There was a lot of noise and confusion. Everyone was eager to get down. They were pushed back by those who wanted to get in. My friend waved to me. I helped him in moving down his luggage. Soon the guard whistled and the train moved off. Now the platform looked deserted.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DELHI METRO RAIL</strong><br />
(by Shweta)</p>
<p>The Delhi Metro Rail was commissioned by the Prime Minister on 25 December, 2002. Initially it is to run between Tis Hazari and Shahdara, but gradually more areas will be covered. It is an electricity run, fully non-polluting train. The doors dose automatically before the train starts. Hence there is greater safety of the passengers during travel. It is expected to carry around two lakh persons everyday and generate a revenue of upto <span id=":g9.co" class="tL8wMe EMoHub" dir="ltr">₹</span> 8 lakhs. There is a scramble for travelling by metro and several schools are interested in taking their students for a joy ride. Delhi is proud of its Metro. It is evident from the fact that metro rail was the tableau from Delhi State in the 2003 Republic Day Parade and Delhi Lieutenant Governor Vijay Kapoor termed commissioning of the Delhi Metro as the most remarkable event in the whole year. Delhiites can really feel proud of travelling in a fast moving, safe, pollution-free train.</p>

Suddenly, the flat started shaking violently. The clock fell down at 8.40 a.m. I looked out of my fifth floor apartment. The building opposite was swaying. Suddenly it started collapsing. The ceiling fan and lamps in my room were also swaying violently. I heard a loud crashing sound. I called my mother and father and ran towards the door. The staircase was already overcrowded. People were shouting. Children were crying. My son Rohit also began to sob. My wife soothed him. The building was now rocking more violently. As we reached the ground floor, I saw cracks in it. Somehow we managed to reach my car and drove away. As I reached open space, I saw dust and rubble all around. Ahmedabad had become a devastated area with lakhs of people trapped under the debris.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A FIGHT BETWEEN A LANDLORD AND HIS TENANT</strong><br />
[fry Disha]</p>
<p>Quarrels between a landlord and his tenant are a common occurrence in Indian cities. Yesterday I witnessed a fight between a landlord and his tenant in our block. They were engaged in a heated argument. The landlord was asking the tenant for rent at enhanced rates, but the tenant consistently refused to yield to his demand for enhancement. He argued that the house lacked even essential facilities. From exchange of hot words, they soon turned to exchange of blows. I reached there, neighbours and other also, flocked to the scene. All of us tried to pacify them. Our intervention seemed to add fuel to the fire. Each tried to shout down the other. Then I and some other neighbours separated them .and took them some distance apart. Our conciliatory efforts seemed to bear fruit. Just then there was a barrage of taunts and abuses from inside the house. It seemed that the wives of the landlord and the tenant had now jumped in the fray. This flared up the two gentlemen. From verbal exchanges, they came to physical handling, blows, pulls and pushes. Meanwhile, a police van arrived and took them in custody on the charge of breach of peace. They reached a compromise at the police station and were released on bail.</p>

</span></strong>During the summer vacation Mahesh visited his grandfather living in his native village Gauripur. It was a very pleasant yet unusual experience for him. Look at the pictures given below and write about this and other such experiences in 150-200 words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NATIVE VILLAGE REVISITED</strong><br />
( by Mahesh )</p>
<p>I had been to my native village five years ago and had very faint memories. But when I visited my grandfather during this summer vacation, all the earlier experiences were revived. What a contrast the village presented. Instead of bullocks, I saw tractors ploughing the fields. Electric motors were drawing water to irrigate fields which were full of tall and green maize plants. Many trees were planted on the boundaries of the farm. However, the scene at the village pond remained more or less unchanged. I could still notice buffaloes lying in water, a boy riding one of them and rural women washing clothes there. What shocked me was that filthy water from drains was being carried to the pond. The old habits of villagers still persisted. Heaps of rubbish and dung were lying here and there. Stray dogs and pigs were wallowing in the dirt and mud. I beat a hasty retreat to my farm house as I could not stand the filth and nauseating smell.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A ROOM OF MY OWN</strong><br />
[by XYZ]</p>
<p>My room is place of my own in our vast new house. I have planned to set it up and decorate it according to my heart. It will reflect my personality. The walls will be painted off-white: neither shining like ivory nor dull like cream. It will have linings of golden brown to mark the boundaries of the doors, windows and cupboards. My bed cover, curtains and pictures will be matching/contrasting the colour scheme of walls/ ceiling. I'll like to avoid overcrowding my room. So I'll keep minimum furniture-my bed, a study table, shelves for books and music system. The cupboard for clothes will be built in the walls. I shall put on my painting on the front wall and of Sachin and Hritik on the sidewalls. The vase in the comer will have fresh flowers to make my room fragrant and beautiful.</p>

We made full preparations and launched our mission on a moon-lit night. The ascent on the hill was not difficult, but the eerie atmosphere sent a chill down our spine. The creaky sound of the old tree and hooting of an owl frightened Vibhu, but Anshu encouraged us. With the help of a stick we opened a window and crept in. What we saw inside amazed us. It was neat and clean and a printing machine and computer were there. As we examined closely we found wads of <span id=":g9.co" class="tL8wMe EMoHub" dir="ltr">₹</span> 500 notes in a box. I took out one of them. In the morning we reported the matter to the police. The house was raided and anti-social elements who printed and circulated fake currency were arrested.

An old lady threw some bananas towards the monkeys. Most of them rushed towards them. However, I did not get respite. One of the monkeys pounced on the balloon I had in my left hand. It burst with a loud sound. For a moment the monkeys were baffled. I saw my opportunity and moved away silently. Thus I managed to save myself from the monkeys.</p>

Last week I was travelling to Ambala by the Kalka Mail. The train was running at over 150 km per hour. It was passing through the rural area. Suddenly a herd of buffaloes came on the railway track. The driver tried to scare them away by sounding long whistles. The animals not only ignored it but also squat on the track. Now the driver had no option but to apply emergency brakes. The impact was so sudden and severe that many persons fell down from the upper berths. Sudden application of brakes and the momentum of the coaches derailed two coaches. The friction caused by the brakes ignited some inflammable material in the coaches. The coach caught fire. There was panic all around. It was a dark moonless night. Electric supply of the derailed coaches had been disrupted. Extricating the passengers from the burning bogie became an uphill task. Some young men and young girls jumped through the doors, other passengers were given help and support to alight. Two persons had swooned. Their bodies had to be pulled across the floorwood then lowered down the door. They were given mouth- to-mouth respiration. Then rotined consciousness as the impact of the shock lessened.</p>

They ate the best mangoes, and sent inferior ones to the merchant. The latter felt upset but could not pinpoint the culprit. The merchant tried many watchmen, but all of them were found to be dishonest.<br />
At last the merchant had an idea. He put two watchmen in his garden. One was lame, the other was blind. They watched the garden together. They could not pick the fruit. The merchant found them good watchmen and rewarded them.<br />
One day the lame watchman noticed ripe mangoes on a tree. He said, "How sweet and delicious these must be!" The blind watchman said, "The smell is very pleasant. I wish I could taste one." The lame watchman hit upon a plan. They should work as a team. He said, "O, brother! We can fulfil our desire. Please carry me on your shoulders. I will guide you." The blind man did so. The lame watchman showed him the way. Then he picked the best mangoes. They ate them together.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THREE YOUNGMEN AND THE WAITER</strong></p>
<p>Once there lived three youngmen in a town who lived by their wits. The three were good friends and were always on the lookout for entertainment. One of them, who was a short person, was exceptionally clever. They often played tricks on people and always had a good fun.<br />
One day they went to a hotel and played a trick on the waiter. They had eggs, bread, fruit and coffee for breakfast. Then the bulky one said, "Bring the bill." When the waiter brought the bill, each of them wanted to pay it. The short man said, "It is my turn today. I&#8217;ll foot the bill." "No," said the lanky one, "You paid for the dinner. Let me pay now." The bulky one chipped in, "O smart fellows! You want to take all credit. I won't let this happen. I insist that no one else but I will pay the bill." The waiter as well as the other customers were surprised.<br />
As the three youngmen were about to quarrel, the short man suggested a plan. He said to the waiter, "We shall blindfold you. Try to catch one of us. That one will pay the bill. Isn't it simple?"<br />
The waiter agreed to be blindfolded. He tried to catch them, but each of them slipped away. Just then the owner of the hotel came in. The waiter caught him and said, "Look! I have caught you. Now pay the bill." The owner said, "O fool! What are you doing? Have you lost sense?" On being scolded the waiter released the owner and removed the cloth over his eyes. He looked around for the three youngmen. But it was too late now. The trick had worked.<br />

Narrate in about 150-200 words the incidents that liberated you from the habit of procrastination and postponement.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SUNDAY AFTERNOON BLUES</strong></p>
<p>Sunday is a day of rest and repose. People either stay at home and relax or go out in the company of family or Mends to enjoy themself. In either case, they get relief from the routine work of the week. There are, however, some of us who go on accumulating work and postpone it for Sunday. Right after breakfast they get busy in doing the work they have piled up for Sunday. The drudgery goes on till evening. Once I was also ensnared in this web of procrastination and postponement. That Sunday I started in right earnest and enjoyed doing some of the unfinished tasks. I had washed my clothes, cleaned the room and arranged my books. The physical labour and fatigue took its toll on me. As I sat down in front of the computer to complete the assignments I had reserved for Sunday, I felt drowsy. There was no coordination between head, hand and heart. Inept handling of computer further compounded the problems. Even the simple problems became complicated and defied solutions. I committed some error in operations and had to start from the beginning In this state of utter confusion, I had no option but to retire for a couple of minutes. The post-lunch nap stretched to hours. I woke up only when my Mend arrived. Realising my predicament she offered help. Within an hour we were able to complete all the assignments. On being asked the secret of her success, my Mend explained that she did not postpone tasks. She devoted some extra time each day and kept her Sunday free for rest and repose. I took a leaf out of her book and resolved to give up the habit of procrastination and postponement.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 32:<br />
</span></strong>This year the monsoons were quite erratic. It rained incessantly and in plenty at certain<br />
places, whereas large tracts of the country had scanty rains. Suppose you live in an area which had a downpour that disrupted normal life. Narrate in about 150-200 words your activities on such a rainy day.    .<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>COPING WITH THE RAINS</strong></p>
<p>Being drenched in the showers of rain looks good only in films. Children and young boys and girls like bathing in rain. To them rain is a fun. But constant downpour can be irksome. I discovered this unpleasant truth at my own expense last month. The monsoons had lashed our town with all its fury. It had rained non-stop all night. I had to attend an important meeting scheduled at 11.00 a.m. I had prepared hard for it. I came downstairs after getting ready to leave when a fresh burst of torrential rain greeted my arrival in the porch. As I inserted the ignition key to reverse the car on to the road, I was dismayed to find that the road had changed into a pool. The level of water went on rising, as I kept waiting in my car and hoping it to recede. At last my patience gave in and I got out of the car. I tried to contact the organizers in order to acquaint them of my predicament, but could not contact anyone. In desperation I went up to the terrace and began to watch the rain. The more I was eager for the rain to lessen its intensity, the bigger were the rain drops and greater was their speed. I lost all hope of going out. I was doomed to have a forced holiday. "Then why not enjoy the break," said someone in my ear. Instantly my anxiety and worry evaporated in the air and like a teenager I focussed on the rain. I discovered new beauty and enjoyed the thrill of rain dance. The drops of rain had their own song. I listened and enjoyed it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE TWO FRIENDS OF SYRACUSE</strong></p>
<p>Two youngmen, Damon and Pythias lived in Syracuse, which was then ruled over by a cruel king named Dionysius. Once Dionysius heard that Pythias was calling him a cruel ruler. He ordered his men to bring Pythias before him. He said, "I find that you are my enemy; so you shall die." He then ordered his men to take the youngman away and kill him. But pythias wanted to see his old father before his death. So he begged the king, "Give me two weeks. I will see my father and come back. Then you can put me to death". Dionysius did not believe the youngman's words. He said, "Put a man in your place and then go. I will give you two weeks. Will anyone take your place?"<br />
Damon, who loved Phythias and regarded him as his brother, now came up and said, "I will take his place." Dionysius looked at him and said, "Remember that you will be put to death in his place."<br />
Damon was taken to prison and Pythias went home. He saw his father, said good-bye and left for Syracuse at once. On the way he was caught in a storm and was not able to travel for several days.<br />
When two weeks passed, the king went to Damon and asked him to get ready to die. Damon was happy to die because he wanted to save his friend. Pythias arrived at the last minute. The king was moved by their deep love. He said, "You are my friends from today. You are both free."<br />

</span></strong>The food we eat has many flavours-sweet, bitter, sour, tangy, saltish, etc. Children like sweet taste and so do many grown ups. However, it is salt that adds to the sweetness of sweets and makes the food palatable. Construct a story in about 150-200 words to highlight the relative importance of salt and sugar in our life.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SALT AND SUGAR</strong></p>
<p>A rich old man had two daughters. He loved both of them. Once he asked them, "What is the sweetest thing in the world?"<br />
"Sugar", said the older girl.<br />
"Salt", said the younger one.<br />
The old man thought that the younger daughter was mocking him. He said, "If salt is sweeter than sugar, you had better find another home where the cooking is more to your taste." Saying so, he pushed her out of the house.<br />
It was a beautiful summer night. The pretty maiden sat singing in the forest near the father's country house, when a young prince, who had lost his way while hunting, came towards her. Struck by her beauty and gaiety, he fell in love with her. He took her to his palace and proposed to marry her. The girl agreed provided he held a banquet and got dishes prepared as she .directed. The prince readily agreed.<br />
The young bride invited her father to the wedding banquet without telling him who she was. All the dishes were prepared without salt, and the guests began to murmur. "Oh," said the bride's father, "salt is truly the sweatest thing in the world. But when my daughter said so, I threw her out of the house. If only I could see her again and tell her how sorry I was!"<br />
Drawing the veil from her face, the happy girl went up to him and hugged him. Then properly salted dishes were brought in, and all the guests ate their fill.</p>

</span></strong>All of us have to make choices in life. These choices have a far-reaching effect on the course of our life. Good choices build our career and make us successful. Wrong choices pave our way with difficulties and lead to ruin. Narrate in about 150-200 words how the choices of the fairies of the forest regarding their dwelling places brought safety to some of them and suffering to the others.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE FAIRIES OF THE FOREST</strong></p>
<p>Once the fairies of.the forest set out to choose their dwelling places. Some were wise in making their choices and some were foolish.<br />
The wise fairies shunned the trees that stood alone in the open fields, and settled in a thick forest. But the foolish ones said, "Why should we crowd together in a forest? Let us go and live in the lonely trees near the villages, where humans will bring us gifts." So they settled there.<br />
Time passed. Both the groups were happy at their choices. One night a great tempest swept over the country. The lonely trees were blown down, and the foolish fairies became homeless. But the great dense forest resisted the fury of the storm. The wise fairies lived unharmed. The foolish fairies came to the dense forest and sought shelter there.<br />
The wise fairies said to the foolish ones, "People should stand together like a dense forest. It is only the solitary tree, growing unprotected in the open field that is overthrown by a silly thing like a sotrm." The foolish fairies felt ashamed.<br />
