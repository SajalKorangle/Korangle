<li>Too many parents these days can't say no. As a result, they find themselves raising 'children' who respond greedily to the advertisements aimed right at them. Even getting what they want doesn't satisfy some kids; they only want more. Now, a growing number of psychologists, educators and parents think it's time to stop the madness and start teaching kids about what's really important : values like hard work, contentment, honesty and compassion. The struggle to set limits has never been tougher-and the stakes have never been higher. One recent study of adults who were overindulged as children, paints a discouraging picture of their future : when given too much too soon, they grow up to be adults who have difficulty coping with life's disappointments. They also have distorted sense of entitlement that gets in the way of success in the work place and in relationships.</li>
<li>Psychologists say that parents who overindulge their kids, set them up to be more vulnerable to future anxiety and depression. Today's parents themselves raised on values of thrift and self-sacrifice, grew up in a culture where 'no' was a household word. Today's kids want much more, partly because there is so much more to want. The oldest members of this generation were born in the late 1980s, just as PCs and video games were making their assault&#8217; on the family room. They think of MP3 players and flat screen TV as essential utilities, and they have developed strategies to get them. One survey of teenagers found that when they crave for something new, most expect to ask nine times before their parents give in. By every measure, parents are shelling out record amounts. In the heat of this buying blitz, even parents who desperately need to say no find themselves reaching for their credit cards.</li>
<li>Today's parents aren't equipped to deal with the problem. Many of them, raised in the 1960s and 70s, swore they'd act differently from their parents and have closer relationships with their own children. Many even wear the same designer clothes as their kids and listen to the same music. And they work more hours; at the end of a long week, it's tempting to buy peace with 'yes' and not mar precious family time with conflict. Anxiety about the future is another factor. How do well intentioned parents say no to all the sports gear and arts and language lessons they believe will help their kids thrive in an increasingly competitive world? Experts agree: too much love won't spoil a child. Too few limits will.</li>
<li>What parents need to find, is a balance between the advantages of an affluent society and the critical life lessons that come from waiting, saving and working hard to achieve goals. That search for balance has to start early. Children need limits on their behaviour because they feel better and more secure when they live within a secured structure.<br />
Older children learn self-control by watching how others, especially parents act. Learning how to overcome challenges is essential to becoming a successful adult. Few parents ask kids to do chores. They think their kids are already overburdened by social and academic pressures. Every individual can be of service to others, and life has meaning beyond one's own immediate happiness. That means parents eager to teach values have to take a long, hard look at their own.</li>

SPACE TOURISM<br/>
<p>If NSYNC singer Lance Bass can't afford the $20 million price tag for a ride into space now, he should try again in, say, a decade.<br />
But within a decade or so, even some of Bass's fans could afford a quick and safe trip to the suborbital edge of space - roughly 50-60 miles above earth, says Frank Seitzen, <strong>5</strong> president of the Space Transport Association.<br />
"I think you're maybe 10 or 12 years away from having companies that are reliable and that can go through that process for $5,000 or $10,000," Seitzen said.<br />
There's a hungry demand from would-be space tourists and a $10 million prize is inspiring designers. The X Prize, created in 1994 to spur the development of new space travel <strong>10</strong> technologies, has attracted at least 21 space vehicle designs from people in five countries. The non-profit X Prize Foundation, founded by a group of donors inspired by the $25,000 Orteig Prize that Charles Lindbergh won in 1927, will give the prize.</p>
<p>Each design team is hoping to develop the first reusable rocket capable of blasting a pilot and two to five passengers to a height of 62 miles. NASA awards astronaut status for <strong>15</strong> flights above 50 miles.<br />
Some design contestants boast that such trips will be available by 2005, although the first few travellers will face $100,000 bills until the market matures.<br />
Despite steep prices and lagging technology, Seitzen and others are convinced that a lucrative travel business awaits. Space Adventures, a travel agency that helped coordinate the first <strong>20</strong> tourist trip to the International Space Station last year by US businessman Dennis Tito, claims it has collected $2 million in deposits from more than 120 would-be suborbital tourists. For client Wally Funk, who has paid her deposit, suborbital travel is a disappointing, yet feasible, alternative to decades of trying to reach space. Funk, a retired aviation safety investigator says, "I would do (a space station trip) in a heartbeat, but I can't because I'm <strong>25</strong> not a millionaire."</p>
<p>Compared to Tito's groundbreaking effort last year, future suborbital flights look easy. Tito was subjected to rigid medical requirements and a gruelling six-month training course in Russia.<br />
But suborbital travellers will need only a few days of training and, pending FAA approval, <strong>30</strong> would have to pass a much lower bar for medical standards.<br />
"We always say that if you can safely ride a rollercoaster, then you are fit for a suborbital flight," says Space Adventures spokeswoman Tereza Predescu.<br />
Four commercial spaceports, which launch rockets into space like airports launch planes, are already licensed to operate by the FAA in Virginia, California, Alaska and Florida, and <strong>35</strong> they are eager to welcome extra business from space tourists, negating the need to catch a ride to Russia.<br />
For those reasons, suborbital travel may represent a $1 billion a year market, according to Space Adventures President and CEO Eric Anderson. Translated, that's 10,000 travellers paying $100,000 each during the first few years of adventure space travel.<br />

INDOOR POLLUTANTS
<ol>
<li>Call it a blessing or a curse of Mother Nature, we have to breathe in over 10,000 litres of air in a day (more than four million litres in a year) to remain alive. By making it essential for life, God has wished that we try to keep the air we breathe clean. Everyone can see the food that is not clean and perhaps refrain from eating it, but one cannot stop breathing even if one can feel the air to be polluted.</li>
<li>Several harmful and noxious substances can contaminate the air we breathe. Generally, much is said and written about outdoor air pollution, most of which is due to vehicular and industrial exhausts.</li>
<li>Given the fact that most of us spend over 90% of our time indoors, it is most important to recognise that the air we breathe in at home or in offices can be polluted. It can be a cause of ill-health. Air pollutants that are generally present in very low concentrations can assume significance in closed ill-ventilated places.</li>
<li>The indoor air pollution can lead to allergic reactions and cause irritation to the skin, the eyes and the nose. But as is logical to assume, the brunt of insult by pollutants is borne by the lungs. It can lead to the development of fresh breathing problems, especially in those who have allergic tendencies, or it can worsen the existing respiratory illnesses like asthma and bronchitis.</li>
<li>There can be several sources of indoor air pollution. Tobacco smoke is one of the most important air pollutants in closed places. "Passive smoking" or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) pollution can lead to all the harmful effects of tobacco smoking seen in the smokers in their non-smoking companions. ETS as a health hazard has been unequivocally proven and is also getting social recognition now. One can occasionally see signs displaying the all-important message: "Your smoking is injurious to my health" in offices and homes. The children of smoking parents are among the worst affected persons.</li>
<li>The exposure of young children to ETS leads to increased respiratory problems and hospital admissions as compared to non-exposed children. Several studies, including those done at the PGI, have shown an increased risk of lung cancer among women exposed to passive smoking. ETS also worsens the existing lung diseases like asthma and bronchitis.<br />
It may be responsible for the development of asthma in children.</li>
<li>The next most important source of indoor air pollution is the allergens. House dust mites (HDM) are very small insects not visible to the naked eye and are the commonest source of allergy in the house. They are ubiquitous and thrive in a warm and moist atmosphere. They breed very fast and are very difficult to eradicate. Modem houses present ample breeding spaces for them in the form of carpets, curtains, mattresses, pillows, etc.</li>
<li>Exposure to HDM can be prevented by the frequent washing of linen and by encasing the mattresses and pillows in a non-permeable cover. Pets form an important part of life for some of us. But they can add plenty of allergens to our indoor atmosphere. Cats are notorious for doing this. Fine particles from feline fur can remain stuck to the upholstery and carpets for a long time* even after the removal of the animal and lead to the worsening of asthma and skin allergies. Fortunately, owing to religious and social customs cats are not very popular pets in India. Dogs, however, are quite popular and can be as troublesome. Pets should be kept out of the bedrooms and washed frequently. To remove the fur particles one has to use vacuum cleaners as the ordinary broom and mop are not effective.</li>
<li>Moulds, fungi and several other microorganisms thrive in damp conditions and can lead to allergies as well as infections. Humidifiers in the air-conditioning plants provide an ideal environment for certain types of bacteria and have led to major outbreaks of pneumonia. It is important to clean regularly the coolers, air-conditioners and damp areas of the house such as cupboards, lofts, etc to minimise this risk.</li>
<li>Toxic gases can also pollute the indoor environment. Biomass fuels (wood, cowdung, dried plants) and coal, if burned inside, can lead to severe contamination by carbon monoxide (CO): The poor quality of stoves and other cooking or heating appliances that cause incomplete combustion of LPG can also lead to the emission of CO or nitrogen dioxide.<br />
Formaldehyde (a gas) can be released from adhesives that are used for fixing carpets, upholstery and also in making plywood and particleboard.</li>
<li>The gases are very toxic in high concentrations as may be encountered during industrial accidents, but even in very minimal amounts, as may be prevalent in homes and offices, they can cause irritation to the skin or the eyes, rashes, headache, dizziness and nausea. Improving the ventilation is an important preventive measure, besides trying to eliminate the source that may not be always feasible.</li>
<li>Other indoor pollutants are toxic chemicals like cleansing agents, pesticides, paints, solvents and inferior-quality personal-care products, especially aerosols. Very old crumbling pipes, boilers, insulation or false roofing can also be important sources. Asbestos is a hazardous product that can cause cancer in humans.</li>
<li>It is important to realise that the air we breathe at home may not be clean always andwe must try to eliminate the source of pollution. We should give due consideration to ventilation.</li>

ELECTRONIC JUNK MAIL
<p>You would have seen an increasing amount of "junk mail" showing up in your e-mail box. The so-called harmless activities of a small number of people are increasingly becoming a serious problem for the Internet.<br />
Spam is the flooding of the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it.<br />
Spam is basically electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings. It is sometimes confused with any unsolicited e-mail. But an old friend may also find your e-mail address on the Net and send you a message but this could hardly be called spam, even though it is unsolicited. Real spam is generally e-mail advertising for some product sent to a <strong>10</strong> mailing list or newsgroup.<br />
In addition to wasting people's time with unwanted e-mail, spam also eats up a lot of network bandwidth. There are many organisations and individuals who have taken it upon themselves to fight spam with a variety of techniques. The problem is that because the Internet is public, there is very little that can be done to prevent spam, just as it is impossible to prevent junk mail.</p>
<p>One of the most recent examples of large-scale spamming was the hoax Ericsson e-mail about a free give away, something most people just cannot resist. The letter begins with a claim that since Nokia is giving away telephones, Ericsson will respond by giving away brand new WAP phone. But the recipient must forward the letter to a minimum of 20 <strong>20</strong> people to receive the phone. The letter is signed by Anna Swelund, Executive Promotion Manager for Ericsson Marketing. It was later discovered that there was no such person at Ericsson.<br />
There are numerous instances of these e-mails being used maliciously by someone who has a grudge against an ex-spouse, a public official, a former teacher or someone else with an e-mail address. The person mentioned in the e-mail ends up with thousands of requests from people looking for confirmation that the e-mail-which they actually had nothing to do with-is true.<br />
Spamming works on our own greed to receive freebies. You are instructed by a total stranger (or a well meaning but not very bright friend) to forward a message you know <strong>30</strong> nothing about, except for the fact that maybe a friend passed it along to you and about 90 of their other very close friends.<br />
Very often the victim can receive so many e-mails (and sometimes faxes and phone calls in the more malicious cases) that they have to get a new e-mail box or phone number- thereby ruining established personal and professional communication channels, which was the original intent of the sender.</p>
<p>Most spam is commercial advertising, often for dubious products, get-rich-quick schemes, or quasi-legal services. It costs the sender very little to send-most of the costs are paid for by the recipient or the carriers rather than by the sender.<br />
There are two main types of spam, and they have different effects on internet users. <strong>40</strong> Cancellable Usenet spam is a single message sent to 20 or more Usenet newsgroups. Usenet spam is aimed at "lurkers", people who read newsgroups but rarely or never post and give their address away. Usenet spam robs users of the utility of the newsgroups by overwhelming them with a barrage of advertising or other irrelevant posts. Furthermore, Usenet spam subverts the ability of system administrators and owners to manage the topics they accept on theft1 systems.<br />
E-mail spam targets individual users with direct mail messages. They typically cost users money out-of-pocket to receive. Most of us read or receive our mail through dial-up accounts while the meter is running, so to speak.<br />
There is not much really that can be done to protect yourself except that you can <strong>50</strong> ensure your relative safety by creating internet e-mail accounts like Hotmail or Yahoo which can be easily and frequently changed. Further, these accounts also generally offer the option of blocking senders from whom you get spam and you can also opt to block e-mail which has been copied to more than 20 people.<br />
One can also keep oneself informed about spammers through the Blacklist of Internet Advertisers, a popular report that describes the offending activities of spammers that routinely distribute large mailings via e-mail or post unwelcome advertising on newsgroups. You can also visit www.spam.abuse.net.<br />
Another organisation devoted to countering the destructive effects of spam is MAPS or the Mail Abuse Prevention System. If an offending spammer cannot be shut down, the <strong>60</strong> spammer's ISP may contact MAPS with the subnet addresses allocated to the spammer so those specific addresses may be used instead of the IP address of the entire ISP. The MAPS website at http://mail-abuse.org will yield more useful information on how to counter and control spam.<br />

BURNING PLASTICS IS NO SOLUTION
<p>When plastic waste is burnt, a complex weave of toxic chemicals is released. Breaking down polyvinyl chloride (PVC) - used for packaging, toys and coating electrical wires - produces dioxin, an organochlorine which belongs to the family of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). A recent Dioxin Assessment Report brought out by the United States Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) says the risk of getting cancer from dioxin is ten times higher than reported by the agency in 1994.<br />
Yet the Delhi government is giving the green signal to a gasification project which will convert garbage into energy without removing plastic waste. Former transport minister Rajendra Gupta, the promoter of this project, says this is not necessary.<br />
He claims no air pollution will be caused and that the ash produced can be used as manure. An earlier waste-to-energy project set up in Timarpur failed. The new one, built with Australian assistance, will cost 200 crore. It will generate 25 megawatts of power and gobble 1,000 tonnes of garbage every day.</p>
<p>"Technologies like gasification are a form of incineration," says Madhumita Dutta, central coordinator with Toxics Link, New Delhi. Incineration merely transfers hazardous waste from a solid form to air, water and ash, she points out.<br />
Toxins produced during incineration include acidic gases, heavy metals as well as dioxins and furans. "The 'manure' will be hazardous and a problem to dispose," says Dutta.<br />
Municipal solid waste contains a mix of plastics. Breaking down this waste emits hydrochloric acid which attacks the respiratory system, skin and eyes, resulting in coughing, vomiting and nausea.<br />
Polyethylene generates volatile compounds like formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, both suspected carcinogenic. Breathing styrene from polystyrene can cause leukaemia. Polyurethane is associated with asthma. Dioxin released by PVC is a powerful hormone disrupter and causes birth defects and reproductive problems. There is no threshold dose to prevent it and our bodies have no defence against it.<br />
"Even the best run incinerators in the world have to deal with stringent norms, apart from contaminated filters and ash, making them hugely expensive to operate," says Dutta. In Germany, air pollution devices accounted for two-thirds the cost of incineration. Despite such efforts, the European Dioxin Inventory noted that the input of dioxin into the atmosphere was the highest from incineration.</p>
<p>"India does not have the facility to test dioxin and the cost of setting one up is prohibitively expensive," says Dutta.<br />
Besides, Indian garbage has a low calorific content of about 800 cal/kg, since it has high moisture and requires additional fuel to burn. Toxics Link calculates that the electricity generated from such technology will cost between 5-7 per unit, which is six times higher than conventional energy. India has chosen a dioxin preventive route and burning of chlorinated plastics is prohibited under Municipal Solid Waste and Biomedical Rules.<br />
Nearly 80 per cent of Indian garbage is recyclable or compostable. Resident associations, the informal sector and the municipal corporation can make Delhi's garbage disappear in a sustainable manner. "Instead, the government promotes end of pipeline solutions," says Dutta.</p>

GRAPHOLOGY-AN INDEX TO PERSONALITY
<p>The analysis of handwriting has a long history-some say it goes back to Roman times. Modern graphology began early in the 19th century when French churchman Jean Hippolyte Michon created the first graphological "catalogue" examining, for example, where letters fall on the line, their shape and the pressure exerted.<br />
<strong>5</strong> Allan Conway, a professional graphologist for 12 years says, "Handwriting says more about you than many chosen words, simply because you cannot hide yourself in your handwriting-it's not really your hand that's writing, but your brain. It's your personality frozen in ink."<br />
Despite public skepticism, graphology plays a covert role in British management. <strong>10</strong> Many companies use it for executive recruitment and analysis. Graphology tells them about the candidates' temperaments, highlighting both weaknesses and strengths. There are about 300 movements on an unlined A4 page of writing and students must find and interpret them all. He also needs to know three things about the writers: their sex, their age and if they are left or right-handed. Then he looks for 16 dominant<strong> 15</strong> elements, including the size of the writing, the pressure, the speed and slant of the words, how connected the characters are as well as the form of the connections, the proportions of the "middle zone" (covered by small letters such as "o" and "n") and "upper" and "lower" zones (where letters extend up or down, as with "d" or "p"), and the rhythm and regularity of writing. "But there is one golden rule," Rees says, "No single sign on <strong>20</strong> its own must ever be taken to mean anything."<br />
The principles, according to Conway, are straightforward. The baseline-whether the writing goes straight across the page or slants up and down-helps to determine the writer's state of mind.</p>
<p>A very upward baseline shows a creative, ambitious and outgoing person. A slightly <strong>25</strong> downward one can reveal dissatisfaction or unhappiness though it could simply be a sign of fatigue. "A sharp downward baseline usually indicates serious problems or illness, probably emotional", says Conway, "while a straight one is an excellent sign of emotional stability. An irregular baseline can mean an excitable writer with poor self discipline." The way letters are formed and connected is important: a writer with angular <strong>30</strong> letters, for example, is often persistent and decisive. Arched letters suggest the writer is reluctant to express emotions freely and may appear cold. Where the bottoms of letters are curved like a cup the writer is likely to be open to the world and at ease. And writing with letters threaded-connected together as if by a length of cotton-can indicate speed or laziness. The more connected the letters, the more co-ordinated the patterns of thought. <strong>35</strong> Character size can also be significant. Larger letters tend to suggest vitality, enterprise and self reliance, while small letters can reveal a lack of self-confidence, but are also found in fields of research where concentration and exactness are necessary.<br />
The slant of a person's writing indicates their emotional make-up. Where all the letters <strong>40</strong> are vertical the writer is likely to be some one uncomfortable in groups. For right-handers, left-word slant shows introversion while rightward slant reveals someone outgoing, friendly and ambitious. A constantly varying slant betrays an unpredictable personality.<br />
The spacing between words points to the writer's organizational abilities: wide spacing suggests individuality, extravagance, self-confidence and sociability.<br />
<strong>45</strong> Even the colour of ink a person chooses can be telling. Blue may indicate someone with no desire to be exceptional or pretentious, green likes to impress and red to shock. Brown is often used by people who work in high-security jobs, able to keep secrets, while black shows a demanding or forceful character who wants to make an impression.<br />

COFFEE-HEALTHY BODY AND MIND?
<ol>
<li>The idea that coffee is bad for heart pops up periodically. It was found that regularly drinking very strong coffee could sharply increase cholesterol levels. Researchers even isolated fatlike chemicals, cafestol and kahweol, responsible for the rise.</li>
<li>It turned out that the European brewing method-boiling water sits on the coffee grounds for several minutes before straining &#8211; produces high concentrations of cafestol and kahweol. By contrast, the filter and percolation methods remove all but a trace of these chemicals. Moreover, the studies involved large amounts of coffee-five to six cups a day. Moderate coffee drinkers down only two cups.</li>
<li>Research has also shown that regular, moderate coffee drinking does not dangerously raise blood pressure. And studies have failed to substantiate fears that coffee might trigger abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) in healthy people.</li>
<li>"For heart disease, I think the issue is closed," says Meir Stampfer, an epidemiologist at Harvard who has studied many aspects of coffee and health. "Coffee drinking at reasonable levels is unrelated to heart risk."</li>
<li>Evidence suggests that coffee may help fend off Parkinson's disease. A 30-year study of 8000 Japanese-American men found that avid coffee drinkers had one-fifth the risk of those who didn't drink the brew.</li>
<li>Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, USA, found indirect evidence that Caffeine- the habit forming stimulant in coffee &#8211; may actually combat Parkinson's disease. The caffeine seemed to protect mice brain cells from depletion of the nerve chemical dopamine &#8211; the problem underlying Parkinson's disease in humans. However, these are preliminary findings; human studies have- not consistently supported caffeine's protective role.</li>
<li>The studies on coffee and cancer have focussed on three organs &#8211; and are reassuring. You may remember a brief coffee scare in the early 1980s when a single study linked coffee with pancreatic cancer. A false alarm: Many studies since then have shown that the association is either extremely weak or non-existent.</li>
<li>If there's a connection between coffee and bladder cancer, it possibly applies just to coffee junkies. A reanalysis of ten European studies found an increased risk only among people who drank ten or more cups a day. And studies show that coffee seems to have no adverse influence on the risk of colon cancer.</li>
<li>Caffeine is such a powerful stimulant that the International Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association set limits on how much can remain in the blood during competition. In addition to boosting physical endurance, caffeine increases alertness and improves mood. The buzz may come at a price, though. People who drink more than they're used to may become restless and unable to sleep. Moreover, it's possible to become physically dependent on caffeine in days.</li>
<li>The question now arises: how much to drink? Those with heatburn and anxiety may want to see if cutting back coffee improves their condition. For most people, however, there's virtually no risk in consuming up to three normal cups a day. Harvard's Stampfer tries to keep his coffee drinking irregular enough to avoid habituation: "That way, I can get a buzz when I feel like it."</li>

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
<ol>
<li>Delhi skies were just clear enough last Sunday to let sky-watchers have a ringside view of a close encounter in space: a half-a-mile-wide asteroid buzzing the earth at a distance a little farther than the moon. It was a rare opportunity to watch a close-up of one of these visitors from the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter who often drop in without notice and cause the world's pulse to quicken.</li>
<li>A two-mile wide tumbling rock from space suddenly became the cynosure of all telescopes last month as astronomers proclaimed it 'the most earth-threatening object' ever detected. Preliminary calculations even suggested it might hit the earth in 2019. That it proved to be a false alarm is another matter. What's important is that such celestial brushes may form part of a countdown to Armageddon.</li>
<li>For every asteroid spotted, several whiz by unnoticed, with some actually passing closer to us than the moon. The number of these Near Earth Objects, or NEOs, far exceeds the known list-a catalogue that needs to be completed before it's too late.</li>
<li>Space agencies have projects to push potential earth-grazers off course. But there's yet to be a comprehensive global space watch programme. Most NEOs slip through unnoticed because of limitations to telescope time, technology and funding. So, it's important for governments not to grudge asteroid hunters the resources they badly need to keep a close watch.</li>
<li>A global asteroid monitoring system of sorts already exists in the form of an assorted group of government and private agencies, along with amateur and professional asteroid researchers. But it has no mechanism to assess the risk factors of NEOs or to determine what, and how much, information should be passed on to the public. As a result, the discoveries of more NEOs do not necessarily lead to a corresponding increase in public awareness of the threat they pose. Newspapers, television and movies aren't of much help either, and a confused public is often left wondering what's fact and what's fiction.</li>
<li>In fact, a kind of 'cry-wolf syndrome' sets in after every sighting, lowering the threat perception in the public mind. If or, more likely, when-there's an asteroid strike, events like Hiroshima and September 11 would pale in comparison. In the cosmic shooting gallery, bruisers larger than a mile across probably have a chance of walloping the earth every 100,000 to 300,000 years, while those 330 feet or larger could score a hit every 1,000 to 2,000 years.</li>
<li>The biggies cause the most concern. If a hunk of stone and metal the size of a 20-storey building hits the earth and sets off a million megaton blast, it'd be like a million city- busting bombs going off simultaneously. Deaths could be counted in millions and most of the flora and fauna would vanish.</li>
<li>Didn't the dinosaurs once think the planet would forever be one big Jurassic Park? The poor beasts never had a space programme and became a smorgasbord for a nasty asteroid. The moral then is to have a space watch programme which includes professional and amateur atronomers maintaining a nightly vigil around the globe. A powerful telescope could be placed outside the earth's orbit to monitor the blind spot created by the sun and rule out unexpected impacts.</li>
<li>In the northern hemisphere, scores of professional astronomers constantly scan the dark skies for tiny points of light and their telltale tracks. But the southern hemisphere is yet to have such sky sentinels whose computers could crunch foot-long numbers to find out if the ultimate destination of any of these shadow mountains in space is Planet Earth.</li>

SECOND VISION
<ol>
<li>From the ramparts of the Red Fort for some years now, our prime ministers have been promising the eradication of child labour in hazardous industries.<br />
The truth is, if the government really wanted, child labour in hazardous industries could have been eliminated long time ago; and yes, every Indian child would have been in school by 2003.</li>
<li>The government has failed to eliminate this dehumanisation of childhood. It has also failed to launch compulsory primary education for all, despite the rhetoric. Between 60 and 100 million children are still at work instead of going to school and around 10 million are working in hazardous industries. India has the biggest child population of 380 million in the world, plus the largest number of children who are forced to earn a living.</li>
<li>We have many laws that ban child labour in hazardous industries. According to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, the employment of children (below the age of 14) in hazardous occupations has been strictly banned. But each state has different rules regarding the minimum age of employment; this makes implementation of these laws difficult.</li>
<li>Also, there is no ban on child labour in non-hazardous occupations. The Act applies to the organised or factory sector and not to the unorganised or informal sector where most children find employment as cleaners, servants, porters, waiters, among other forms of unskilled work. Thus, child labour continues because the implementation of the existing laws is lax.</li>
<li>There are industries which have a 'special' demand for child labour because of their nimble fingers, high level of concentration and capacity to work hard at abysmally low wages. The carpet industry in UP and Kashmir employs children to make hand-knotted carpets; there are 80,000 child workers in J&amp;K alone. In Kashmir, because of the political unrest, children are forced to work while many schools are shut. Industries like gem-cutting and polishing, pottery and glass want to remain competitive by employing children.</li>
<li>The truth is that it's poverty which is pushing children into the brutish labour market. We have 260 million people below the poverty line in India, a large number of them are women. Poor, vulnerable parents, especially women-headed families, have no option but to push their little ones in this hard life in hostile conditions, with no human or labour rights.</li>
<li>There is a lobby which argues that there is nothing wrong with children working as long as the environment for work is conducive for learning new skills. But studies have shown that children are made to do boring, repetitive and tedious jobs and are not taught new skills as they grow older. In these hell-holes, like the sweatshops of old, there is no hope.</li>
<li>Children working in hazardous industries are prone to debilitating diseases which can cripple them for life. By sitting in cramped, damp, unhygienic spaces, their limbs become deformed for life. Inside matchstick, fireworks and glass industries, they are victims of bronchial diseases and TB. Their mental and physical development is permanently impaired by long hours of work. Once trapped, they can't get out of the vicious circle of poverty. They remain uneducated and powerless. Finally, in later years, they too are compelled to send their own children to work. Child labour perpetuates its own nightmare.</li>
<li>If the government was at all serious about granting children their rights, an intensive effort ought to have been made to implement the Supreme Court's directive of 1997 which laid down punitive action against employers of child labour (20,000 per child to be paid by offending employers). Only compulsory primary education can eliminate child<br />
labour.</li>
<li>Surely, if 380 million children are given a better life and elementary education, India's human capital would be greatly enhanced. But that needs, as President Abdul Kalam says, a &#8220;second vision&#8221;. Can our political establishment see beyond the haze of shallow realpolitik?</li>

<p>Many of the underdeveloped countries will promote the growth of their economies in one way or the other, no matter whether they receive substantial outside aid in the process or not. The character of that development, however, is likely to be strongly influenced by the types of and amounts of aid available. The outcome is much more likely to be favourable, from the standpoint of the objectives for successful development set up previously, if there is substantial international aid than if there is not.<br />
By substantial aid I mean not only large amounts of technical assistance but also of capital. Initially, the capacity of an underdeveloped country to use capital productively may be surprisingly small, limited by lack of organisation, trained personnel and other social obstacles. At this stage technical assistance is the main need from outside, with comparatively small amounts of capital, much of which may have to be in the form of grants for non-self liquidating projects, in education, health, access to roads in rural areas, and the like, if, at this stage, substantial capital is available from outside to supplement what can be formed internally (and to simulate internal capital formation, for it does that too) the rate of economic growth can be consistently increased, and the strains and frustrations and political risks of the development are likely to be considerably less.<br />
It is possible for underdeveloped economies to modernise themselves with very little capital from outside. Japan imports of capital were small though some of it came at crucial times. The contribution of foreign direct investments to the advancement of technical know-how also was greater than would be indicated merely by the size of the investment. The Soviet Union industrialised its economy with practically no aid from foreign investment capital except for the foreign owned installations confiscated after the revolution, though it imported machinery in the early days on short term or immediate term credits and hired services of foreign experts.<br />
Both Japan and Russia achieved their development in an authoritarian political and social framework. The outcome in both cases from standpoint of the peace in the world and democratic ideals, was highly unfavourable.<br />
In the absence of outside aid, the only way to accumulate capital, is to increase production without taking much of the benefit in more consumption or even while pushing consumption standards down. Where the people are already near the subsistence level this may mean extreme hardship. Somehow the people must be motivated to change their accustomed ways quickly, to work hard and to forgo present consumption so that capital investment can be made.<br />

<p>Among the natural resources which can be called upon in national plans for development, possibly the most important is human labour. Since the English language suffers from a certain weakness in its ability to describe groups composed of both male and female members, this is usually described as "manpower".<br />
Without a productive labour force, including effective leadership and intelligent middle management, no amount of foreign assistance or of natural wealth can ensure successful development and modernisation.<br />
The manpower for development during the next quarter century will come from the world's present population of infants, children and adolescents. But we are not sure that they , will be equal to the task. Will they have the health, the education, the skills, the sociocultural attitudes essential for the responsibilities of development?<br />
For far too many of them the answer is no. The reason is basic. A child's most critical years, with regard to physical, intellectual, social and emotional development, are those before he reaches five years of age. During those critical formative years he is cared for almost exclusively by his mother and in many parts of the world the mother may not have the capacity to raise a superior child. She is incapable of doing so by reason of her own poor health, her ignorance and her lack of status and recognition of social and legal rights, of economic parity of independence. One essential factor has been overlooked or ignored. The forgotten factor is the role of women. Development will be handicapped as long as women remain second-class citizens, uneducated, without any voice in family or community, decisions without legal or economic status, married when they are still practically children, and henceforth producing one baby after another, often to see half of them die before they are of school age.<br />
We can enhance development by improving "women power", by giving women the ' opportunity to develop the&amp;selves. Statistics show that the average family size increases in inverse ratio to the mother's years of education-is lowest among college graduates, highest among those with only primary school training, or no education. Malnutrition is most frequent in large families, and increases in frequency with each additional sibling. The principle seems established that an educated mother has healthier and more intelligent children, and that this is related to the fact that she has fewer children. The tendency of . educated, upper class mothers to have fewer children operates even without access to contraceptive services.<br />
The educational level of women is significant also because it has a direct influence upon their chances of employment, and the number of employed women in a country's total labour force has a direct bearing on both the Gross National Product and the disposable income of the individual family. Disposable income, especially in the hands of women, influences food purchasing and therefore the nutritional status of the family. The fact [ that the additional income derives from the paid employment of women provides a logical incentive to restrict the size of the family.<br />

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>THE STRESS FACTOR</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>While there is no denying that the world loves a winner it is important that you recognise the signs of stress in your behaviour and be healthy enough to enjoy your success. Stress can strike anytime, in a fashion that may leave you unaware of its presence in your life. While a certain amount of pressure is necessary for performance, it is important to be able to recognise your individual threshold. For instance, there are some individuals who accept competition in a healthy fashion. There are others who collapse into weeping wrecks before an exam or on comparing marksheets and finding that their friend has scored better.</li>
<li>It is a body reaction to any demands or changes in its internal and external environment. Whenever there is a change in the external environment such as temperature, pollutants, humidity and working conditions, it leads to stress. In these days of competition when a person makes up his mind to surpass what has been achieved by others, leading to an imbalance between demands and resources, it causes psycho-social stress. It is a part and parcel of everyday life.</li>
<li>Stress has a different meaning depending on the stage of life you're in. The loss of a toy or a reprimand from the parents might create a stress shock in a child. An adolescent who fails an examination may feel as if everything has been lost and life has no further meaning. In an adult, the loss of his or her companion, job or professional failure may appear as if there is nothing more to be achieved.</li>
<li>Such signs appear in the attitude and behaviour of the individual, as muscle tension in various parts of the body, palpitation and high blood pressure, indigestion, hyperacidity and ultimately in self destructive behaviour such as eating and drinking too much, smoking excessively, relying on tranquilisers, trembling, shaking, nervous blinking, dryness of throat and mouth and difficulty in swallowing.</li>
<li>The professional under stress behaves as if he is a perfectionist followed by depression, lethargy and weakness for further work. Periodic mood shifts also indicate the stress status of students, executives and professionals.</li>
<li>In a study sponsored by World Health Organisation and carried out by Harvard School of Public Health, the global burden of diseases and injury indicated that stress diseases and accidents are going to be the major killers in 2020.</li>
<li>The ischaemic heart diseases and neurological depression, both stress diseases, are going to rank first and second in 2020. Road traffic accidents are going to be the third largest killers. These accidents are also an indicator of psycho-social stress in a fast-moving society. Other stress diseases like ulcers, hypertension and neuronal disorders including insomnia have assumed epidemic proportions in modem societies.</li>
<li>A person behaves in different ways in stress but the common ones are flight, fight and flow. Depending upon the nature of stress and capability of the person, the three responses can be elegantly chosen to cope up with the stress so that stress does not damage the system and become distress.</li>
<li>When stress crosses the threshold peculiar to an individual, it deteriorates his/her performance capacity. Frequent jumps over that threshold may result in a syndrome called chronic fatigue in which a person feels lethargic, disinterested and is not easily motivated to achieve anything. This may make the person mentally undecided, confused and accident prone as well. Sudden exposure to un-nerving stress may also result in a loss of memory.</li>
<li>The best technique is self-control. This arises by having faith in oneself, on the usefulness of the job he is doing and on any superpower who would deliver the result of the effort made.</li>
<li>There are many stress modifiers or stress busters. Some of these are diet and massage from naturopathy, food supplements and herbs from herbal medicine hobbies and relaxation techniques, homeopathy and modem medicine. Physical exercise and dance movements are excellent stress modifiers.</li>

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>TELLY BUSTING</strong></span></p>
<p>The children probably don't know, or they don't care, the hugely popular WWF wrestling matches are actually all staged acts. The Hulks, the Undertaker or whatever else they are called-never really punch or kick as hard as they might appear doing on the show. It's all a show, a thrilling show.<br />
So, you can't really blame children for getting hooked. But does that necessarily mean the show is entirely responsible for the beating 12-year-old Subin Kumar got from his WWF-inspired friends? Can viewing or watching violence on TV actually promote aggressive behaviour in children?<br />
Media experts and social scientists have been wrestling with this question for decades <strong>10</strong> and thousands of studies have been done on it. And most of them reached the same conclusion-media violence is responsible for aggressive behaviour in children. Research has found that the more violence children watch on television, the more likely they may act in aggressive ways towards others. Also, they become less sensitive to others' pain and are less likely to help a victim of violence.<br />
A study of violence on Indian television and its impact on children commissioned by UNESCO accused the idiot box of "bombarding young minds with all kinds of violent images, cutting across channels, programmes and viewing times."<br />
Not only studies, but also incidents go to prove that children who watch violent episodes show increased likelihood of behaving aggressively.</p>
<p><strong>20</strong> There have been reports from all over the country of children hurting themselves while trying to ape the superhuman feats of Shaktimaan, the superhero of Indian TV. Then there was the six-year-old child of Lucknow who leapt off the balcony of his second -floor flat trying to imitate a bungee jumping drop shown in a soft drinks commercial. There's no doubt that media is a powerful teacher and contributes greatly to the way we act and behave. In some cases like these, the effects are immediate and in others there is a "sleeper effect", where the results show up much later.<br />
Experts say it's incorrect to blame the media squarely. How would you explain the aggressive behaviour of a child who has never been exposed to television or any other media? So, while there is mounting evidence to link media violence and actual violence, most <strong>30</strong> of it does not prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Because no one so far has been able to prove why and how TV effects some people and not the others. "We also have to take into account individual differences and vulnerabilities as human behaviour is a result of many factors," points out Dr Vasantha R. Patri, a counsellor, adding, "violence viewing is only one of the myriad influences on a growing child."</p>
<p>Patri says there exists a population of risk individuals whose anger, aggression and anti-social tendencies are already quite high for whatever reason. Other factors like individual predisposition of the child, parental attitudes and reaction to aggression are probably equally important. In fact, she says that in most cases media is only the fourth most <strong>40</strong> important influence in a child's life-with parents, teachers and peers being the first three. Patri points out that the growing "here-and-now" culture in which kids are getting used to immediate gratification is leading to an intolerant society on the whole. "Children are not taught how to handle failure and conflict," she says. "As a result, they resort to aggression."<br />
But media critics refuse to buy it. They insist the content of media needs to be monitored and care be taken to reduce violence if not remove it. But even if all the gore and violence is completely removed from the media, will it make a significant difference in the aggressive behaviour of children? And then how do you justify the fact that studies have shown that viewing violence on TV also provides an opportunity to discharge the pent-up, <strong>50</strong> aggressive feelings of anger, hostility and frustration.<br />
"The problem is not with the media, but the lack of media education," points out Patri. "No one teaches the children how to assess the reality status of TV programmes." Good parenting, she says, is perhaps the greatest defense against the negative effects of violent images on TV.<br />
Experts say it's time that parents and teachers took a long, hard look at themselves in the mirror. Says Patri, "Most parents treat TV as a baby-sitter when it suits them. And when something goes wrong, they turn around and blame TV for it !"<br />

<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>MAGIC MACHINE</strong></span></p>
<p>Mohammed Jamshed Khan replaced the ATM card in his wallet and counted the crisp new notes he'd just withdrawn from the machine. 6000? "This can't be right!" thought the young Mumbai civil contractor. He counted again. It was indeed 6000. "All I'd asked for was ? 1200," Khan told his friend Faisal Mukhi who was standing nearby.<br />
"You pressed the wrong buttons, silly," said Mukhi.<br />
"No way!" exclaimed Khan as he pushed his card back in again, keyed in his numeric password and asked for ? 1000. Beep, click&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.whirr, beeeep ! Out popped 5000 and a little transaction slip that read. WITHDRAWAL 1000.<br />
"Let's try again,&#8221; said Khan. Card, password, 2-0-0-0&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.beeeep ! But he got 10,000. By now it seemed certain that the ATM was giving away 500-rupee notes instead of hundreds. "May be something's wrong with your card," Mukhi told Khan, "let me try mine." Mukhi's balance was low-only ? 1300. He pushed his card in and asked for ? 1000. The machine spat out 5000.<br />
"ATMs (short for automated teller machines) are extremely secure and among the hardest of machines. Look up the Encyclopaedia Britannica for "ATMs" and you'll find it entered under "Locks"-it's virtually impossible to fool an ATM. And the probability of an ATM overpaying is virtually nil. But here they were, two buddies with ? 26000 between them- 20,800 of it free money.<br />
There were no other customers in sight on that warm July afternoon. And they could have kept on going. Instead, Khan and Mukhi went outside the ATM's enclosure and summoned the guard on duty. "The machine's all mixed up," they told him. The two men then gave the guard a demo: "Look here," said Khan as he inserted his card one last time and hit the buttons, "I'm withdrawing ? 500 but here's 2500!<br />
"Don't let anybody near this place," they told the guard as they hopped into an autorickshaw and sped off with all the money.-<br />
It looked like a daylight robbery-in reverse. For they drove two kilometres, to the nearest branch of the bank that owned the ATM, placed the cash-? 28,500 on the bank manager's desk and complained about their faulty machine.<br />
'We could have lost a real lot that day," says the manager. This is the kind of honesty we can only dream about. A human error made while loading cash in the ATM had caused the problem. Although we could have traced the customers, it might have meant a lot of trouble for us, had they kept our money."<br />
But did either Mohammed Khan or Faisal Mukhi ever think of keeping the money during their moment with the magic machine? "Not once," says Khan. Adds Mukhi: "Never."<br />

<strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">REACHING THE PEAK</span></strong></p>
<p>My dad and I both started playing tennis at the same time in 1967. Though I was small for my age, I was fast on my feet and seemed to have an instinct for where my opponent would hit his next shot. At the age of nine, I put on my white shorts and shirt and started playing in tennis tournaments around the New York area. By the time I was 12,1 was No. 7 in the <strong>5</strong> country in the under-12 category. When I was 16,1 won my first national singles title. Then, in 1977, as a chubby faced 18-year old with brown ringlets and a red headband, I came out of nowhere to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon. Though I wouldn't have told a soul back then, that's when I realized I had the potential to be the best tennis player in the world.<br />
<strong>10</strong> I worked my way up the ranks and by 1979,1 was world No. 3, hunting down Jimmy Connors and Bjorn Borg. I was winning a lot and I loved it-loved being the lone gunfighter. I won the US Open in both '79 and '80. Then, more and more, the problem became that almost everybody was somebody I shouldn't lose to. There was so much pressure to win in the early rounds of tournaments and make it to the finals. To conquer the pressure, I tried <strong>15</strong> building defences that almost nothing (and nobody) could get through.<br />
But behind my defences were''some very dark places. There was always a devil inside me that I had to fight against. And that devil was fear of failure.<br />
Eventually I had made it to the finals at Wimbledon that year, earning the rematch I'd badly wanted with Borg. Though I'd beaten the great, smooth Swede in last year's US <strong>20</strong> Open, Borg had won Wimbledon an incredible five times in a row, including against me. I got off to a sluggish start. I was tight, over impressed with the occasion. Borg won the first set, 6-4.<br />
As I loosened up, the match turned into a dog fight. I won a tie breaker in the second set, and the third set was going in that direction too. Underneath my nerves and my <strong>25</strong> certainty that I had to play every point to my utmost, a strange idea was starting to materialise: He's not quite as hungry as last year. This match is mine to take, if I can take it. After that, I knew in my bones that I was going to win, and I did. The final score was 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4. When I beat Borg at the US Open a few months later, I officially replaced him as world <strong>30</strong> No. 1. I had thought that No. 2 was a pretty big deal. But No. 1 was a very strange place indeed-the peak of the mountain, the icy winds blowing around my head.<br />
For four years I was the biggest winner in men's tennis.<br />

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
<p>As a medium of literary expression, the common language is inadequate. Like the man of letters, the scientist finds it necessary to "give a purer sense to the words of the tribe". But the purity of scientific language is not the same as the purity of literary language. The aim of the scientist is to say only one thing at a time, and to say it unambiguously and with the greatest possible clarity. To achieve this, he simplifies and jargonises. In other words, he uses the vocabulary and syntax of common speech in such a way that each phrase is susceptible to only one interpretation; and when the vocabulary and syntax of common speech are too imprecise for his purpose he invites a new technical language, or jargon specially designed to express the limited meaning with which he is professionally concerned. At its most perfectly pure form, scientific language ceases the matter of words and terms into mathematics.<br />
The literary artist purifies the language of the tribe in a radically different way. The scientist's aim, as we have seen, is to say one thing, and only one thing at a time. This, most emphatically, is not the aim of the literary artist. Human life is lived simultaneously on many levels and has many meanings. Literature is a device for reporting the multifarious facts and expressing their various significance. When the literary artist undertakes to give a pure sense to the words of his tribe, he does so with the express purpose of creating a language capable of conveying, not the single meaning of some particular science, but the multiple significance of human experience, on its most private as well as on its more public levels.<br />

qproSTOPPING BY WOODS ON A SNOWY EVENING<br/>
<p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br />
His house is in the village, though;<br />
He will not see me stopping here<br />
To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br />
My little horse must think it queer<br />
To stop without a farmhouse near<br />
Between the woods and frozen lake<br />
The darkest evening of the year.<br />
He gives his harness bells a shake<br />
To ask if there is some mistake.<br />
The only other sound's the sheep<br />
Of easy wind and downy flake.<br />
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br />
But I have promises to keep,<br />
And miles to go before I sleep,<br />

qproALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE<br/>
<p>All the world's a stage,<br />
And all the men and women merely players;<br />
They have their exits and their entrances,<br />
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br />
His acts being seven ages.<br />
At first, the infant,<br />
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.<br />
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br />
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br />
Unwillingly to school.<br />
And then the lover,<br />
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br />
Made to his mistress' eyebrow.<br />
Then a soldier,<br />
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br />
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br />
Seeking the bubble reputation<br />
Even in the cannon's mouth.<br />
And then the justice, &#8216;<br />
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br />
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br />
Full of wise saws and modem instances;<br />
And so he plays his part.<br />
The sixth age shifts<br />
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br />
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br />
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br />
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br />
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br />
And whistles in his sound.<br />
Last scene of all,<br />
That ends this strange eventful history,<br />
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br />

cproNote-Making & Summarisingpcro
qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
<ol>
<li>I remember my childhood as being generally happy and can recall experiencing some of the most carefree times of my life. But I can also remember, even more vividly, moments of being deeply frightened. As a child, I was truly -terrified of the dark and getting lost. These fears were very real and caused me some extremely uncomfortable moments.</li>
<li>Maybe it was the strange way things looked and sounded in my familiar room at night that scared me so much. There was never total darkness, but a street light or passing car lights made clothes hung over a chair take on the shape of an unknown beast. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw curtains move when there was no breeze. A tiny creak in the floor would sound a hundred times louder than in the daylight and my imagination would take over, creating burglars and monsters. Darkness always made me feel helpless. My heart would pound and I would lie very still so that 'the enemy' wouldn't discover me.</li>
<li>Another childhood fear of mine was that I would get lost, especially on the way home from school. Every morning, I got on the school bus right near my home-that was no problem. After school, though, when all the buses were lined up along the curve, I was terrified that I would get on the wrong one and be taken to some unfamiliar neighbourhood. I would scan the bus for the faces of my friends, make sure that the bus driver was the same one that had been there in the morning, and even then ask the others over and over again to be sure I was in the right bus. On school or family trips to an amusement park or a museum, I wouldn't let the leaders out of my sight. And of course, I was never very adventurous when it came to taking walks or hikes because I would go only where I was sure I would never get lost.</li>
<li>Perhaps, one of the worst fears I had as a child was that of not being liked or accepted by others. First of all, I was quite shy. Secondly, I worried constantly about my looks, thinking people wouldn't like me because I was too fat or wore braces. I tried to wear 'the right clothes' and had intense arguments with my mother over the importance of wearing flats instead of saddled shoes to school. Being popular was very important to me then and the fear of not being liked was a powerful one.</li>
<li>One of the processes of evolving from a child to an adult is being able to recognise and overcome our fears. I have learnt that darkness does not have to take on a life of its own, that others can help me when I am lost and that friendliness and sincerity will<br />
encourage people to like me. Understanding the things that scared us as children helps to cope with our lives as adults.</li>

If you live in a rapidly urbanising India, especially in the North, and feel that things are getting from bad to worse as far as civility, sensitivity and respect for law is concerned, you are not alone.<br />
I go out cycling almost every morning, at the crack of dawn. The total lawlessness that has come to grip the society scares me. As early as 5 am, our cycling group notices people huddled around their cars, drinking outside eateries or liquor joints, fighting, arguing loudly, or simply passing lewd comments at the women riders in our group. The comments do not vary from a Mercedes or a Maruti Swift. They are uniformly distasteful. We often see police vehicles at these joints too, and they are certainly not there attending to an SOS call.<br />
Several of you would remember the horrific accident that took place in Gurgaon. Forty seven year old Avinash Shah, driving his small car with his wife and daughter was hit by a businessman test driving a powerful new Audi. Avinash died instantly and his wife and daughter barely survived.<br />
The gent who rammed the big Audi into the small car, is out on bail. According to eye-witnesses, soon after ramming into Avinash's car, this gent got out, made a few phone calls using his mobile, and got picked up by his own driver in his car and vanished. The police said they did not have his address for two days despite knowing that he was on a test drive and had deposited his driving licence at the car showroom before taking the car out. Two days later, this gent reappeared, with a lawyer in toe and surrendered, only to be bailed out in a jiffy.<br />
Why is it that things are reaching such a pass? Sudden wealth, easy availability of 'good things' in life, general feeling that money can buy anything, or what else? Is it just a North Indian phenomenon or nationwide? Why it is that uncouth, uncivil and insensitive behaviour is all pervasive?,,Why is the society so willing to circumvent, indeed buy, law at will? Do you think the media is responsible having abdicated its responsibilities by concentrating on flashy things alone while bypassing the real issues that would positively impact the society?<br />
Whatever the answer to those questions is, the solution lies with us alone. We need to stop accepting being pushed around. An individual cannot take on those who mock at our law, but together we can do wonders. The choice is ours, whether to stare down the barrel of the gun as lawlessness gains ground faster than these guys drive their fast cars, or start coming together to challenge the perpetrators of these crimes. I have often heard the argument that our economy is growing rapidly and this is just a brief side effect of such growth. I would rather have a slower growth rate of economy, but a saner, civilised society to live in.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
An Indian visitor to Cairo stopped to hear a muezzin's melodious call to prayer. When the azzan had ended, the muezzin approached the visitor and, in rudimentary English, asked where he was from. "India", replied the visitor. "Muslim?" asked the muezzin. "No", said the visitor. "Little bit Muslim?" asked the muezzin. "Yes, little bit Muslim," agreed the visitor.<br />
That exchange represents a cross-cultural tribute to what is often referred to as India's long tradition of eclecticism, or what might be called Indutva. It is a tradition based on anekantavada, the ability to see the other person's point of view. Or as a western philosopher has put it, the realisation that the opposite of a great truth need not be a lie but another, and equally valid great truth.<br />
This ambiguity of faith, this welcoming of multiplicity, is the bedrock of Indie civilisation, of Indutva. It is not an acceptance but a celebration of the fact that, at times, we can all be a little bit of this and a little bit of that. The Indian knack of being able to absorb and internalise whatever comes our way is often compared to a sponge which soaks up any moisture that it comes into contact with. It's an inaccurate metaphor, for a sponge is a passive object, its capacity to absorb is not elective, not something that it chooses. Indian eclecticism, or Indutva, on the contrary, is highly creative; there is nothing passive or<br />
constrained about it. It is an active engagement with diverse cultural norms and beliefs, which it seeks to link. It's like a universal language of faith, a spiritual Esperanto, if you like. Indutva's vocabulary includes idioms not just from the major belief systems like Islam, Sikhism and Buddhism, but of minor religions as well which India has made its own, 1 and which include Westminster style democracy and cricket.</p>
<p>The great majority of Indians are Hindu. But there are almost as many kinds of Hinduism as there are Hindus. There are atheist Hindus, and Hindus who eat beef. There are Hindus who partly believe in Islam, and Muslims who are part Hindus, like the Sufis. There are Hindus who are Buddhists, or Jains, or vice versa; Hindus who are part Christians, like the Brahmos, and Christians who remain Hindus, like converts who retain their caste and other social traditions even after embracing Christianity.<br />
Long before we had multiplex cinema halls in India, we had multiple places of worship, like the Shantadurga Shrine in Goa which attracts devotees who are both Hindus and Christians-or, indeed, who are neither. Salim Chisti's memorial in Fatehpur Sikri-where pilgrims of all faiths flock-is another example of the multiplicity of Indutva. Shrines apart, Holi and Diwali, Eid and Christmas, are celebrated by people of all creeds. Indutva is a bouquet of many faiths, a garland of festivals.<br />
You are invited to identify and explore the myriad strands that, over the millennia, have been inextricably woven together to create the seamless fabric of Indutva, to which new threads are added every day.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
An era, a culture is eventually determined by its news. What is missed out by those who track the news of that time is lost forever. We know nothing about Shakespeare's contemporaries even though some of them may have been better playwrights. We know nothing about those who came in with Babar, or around the same time, to loot India and stayed back as rulers. Or the many soldiers of fortune who landed here during the time of the East India Company. We know of a few and, apart from avid historians, no one knows who led the Portuguese, Dutch or French into India or ran their empires here till they were dismantled. Why is that? Simple. The media of that time, known as historians, did not mention them.<br />
We who consume news today see it as a fleeting experience. We observe a powerful image on TV, are moved by its impact or repelled by its horror, and move on. We read a headline today and can't even recall it tomorrow. Current news always drives out the old (often with ruthless cunning) and It's only when the media goes back in time to recall a particular (7 story that we suddenly remember that, yes, there was something called HDW or Bofors that once shook up the entire nation and held it in thrall for a decade. We are suddenly reminded that Congress treasurer LN Mishra was mysteriously killed in a bomb blast on<br />
a train and no one ever knew who killed him or where his secret millions vanished.<br />
Since I'm a journalist I can tell you many such stories. There are others too, full of stories.<br />
But, like news, the stories die with them. History only remembers what it chooses to, or what is indelibly stamped on its pages. The rest is occasionally recalled as gossip. But is it gossip? Or is it truth that we are trying to forget so that we can move on and make space in our hearts and minds for more recent news? Our memory, collective as well as individual, has limited storage and however many data cards we may insert, there's simply too much to absorb and retain. The information surge that hits us every morning is so i large, so intimidating that we remember only a tiny fraction of it. It's that fraction which actually scares us by the possibility of impacting our lives.<br />
The gap between news and entertainment was always sacrosanct. News was about facts. Entertainment was about imagination, ergo fiction. To see them occupy the same media platforms today is scary for those like me who have spent a lifetime pursuing facts in the search for news. Even the dividing line has blurred. What we once shunned as preposterous lies slip in so casually today into our news menu. It's no one's fault. It's just that the fault lines have shifted. News has become just another consumable, another platform to commercially (and cynically) exploit. No, don't blame our journalists and media owners. They are only following a global model that, for better or for worse, is making our times an entirely forgettable chapter of history.</p>

It was bound in a rough, red cloth, now smoothened in places with the many caresses it had received over the years. Its name boldly etched in gold over its hard cover. Its spine still holding on firmly to the age old pages, much thumbed, dog-eared, yellowing pages. Its illustrations, lithographs by the author himself, and a frayed red ribbon placed between the pages I had read the last time. That is my favourite book. .<br />
That book startled me off on a journey that inevitably took me to the book alleys that still make the three hundred year old city proud. The fact that my lane meandered through several by-lanes and reached the book alleys in less than fifteen minutes made my trips frequent and my pocket-money meagre. The narrow lanes were lined with small shops with dusty shelves. Their bespectacled shop-owners-bibliophiles in their own right-were always eager to help me find treasures in all shapes and sizes, bound in cloth or leather, some new and some which had changed several hands; others which had comers folded, many in tatters, a few boasting of an autograph or a note written in attention of a loving reader. My prized possession in those days was a book called Sita that was illustrated with paintings by the illustrious Raja Ravi Verma.<br />
Nothing gave me more pleasure than the feel of a cold spine against my palm, the weight of the pages, their slight reluctance to open spontaneously, the faint crick at the turn of each page, and the musty smell of the yellowing pages mixed with a slight whiff of the jet-black ink that filled my nostrils as I brought the book close to my face.</p>
<p>Thus enamoured by books of all shapes and sizes, colours and textures and thus pampered by the abundance of such gems in dusty attics and tiny shop windows, I stepped out of my city's boundaries and stepped into different cities. As a resident in some, whilst a tourist in others. My experiences in each of those cities have been varied as have been my encounter with books.<br />
In the beginning, I would wait to return from those cities and visit the old, familiar book alleys for my ration of books for the rest of the year. But soon I realised that the character of the alleys, the shops lining them and the books they sold had started to change. The old, dusty spines of ageless classics were fast being replaced by Last Minute Suggestions for Board Examinations, Questions &amp; Answers Made Easy, cheap reprints of old classics, poor translations of world famous children's classics and photocopies of what were otherwise intellectual masterpieces. Makeshift shops had encroached upon the pavements<br />
of the narrow alleys and had started to threaten the original inhabitants themselves. Disappointment was inevitable, and it didn't take too long to set in. Like many others, I soon decided it was time to park my hopes elsewhere.</p>

Canada says its denial of visas to Indian security officials on grounds of human rights violations, torture and espionage is a mistake.<br />
India was hurt to the quick at the charges. The government issued an angry warning and said it would take retaliatory measures if Canada did not take corrective measures. Now that it has done so, the two countries could resume the pleasantries. But that wouldn't alter the truth. And the truth is that Indian security forces, like most other security forces in the world, routinely commit human rights violations, certainly torture and seriously play at espionage.<br />
Now, we can protest our innocence and act righteous. But we'd be deceiving ourselves. The security forces anywhere in the world will do all these. That is their job. But unlike the more civilised west, our men are not accountable. Consider the high number of custodial deaths -127 last year alone, according to NHRC, or any number of torture cases. This is a primitive country and sees in violence a kind of catharsis. The recent baying for Kasab's public execution, preceded by chopping of limbs is a case in point.<br />
So, instead of getting hot under the collar, the Indian authorities should be thanking Canada for holding up a mirror to our ugly face. It is through such diplomatic slip-ups that we know how we are really perceived in a world, at least a part of which is seriously giving a shot at evolving ethically driven societies.<br />
I suggest Canada take back its apology, and ask India to prove its credentials of civility. And I suggest Indians stop flattering brainwashing themselves into thinking, no doubt with the help of an embarrassingly patriotic media, that they have arrived. The truth, ah, comrade, is we have just about started and it's such a long way to go.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
Tomorrow, May 31, is when Delhi's tongas go off the road. In one stroke, over 200 tongawallahs will be left with no option but to discontinue a profession that many of them have been involved in, for generations. It will also be the end of a way of life for many people in old Delhi - used to having the tonga in their midst for commuting around the area. Or, for those who are dependent on it for their livelihood, like horse-shoe makers and cleaners.<br />
Why are tongas being phased out? Apparently, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) decided last year that the tongas cause congestion and pose a threat to traffic security. Therefore, they have to go. It seems to be a knee-jerk reaction, at best. Even if one were to accept MCD's argument, banning tongas completely is hardly a solution to Delhi's traffic mess. Considering that there are almost 10-15 lakh rickshaws in the capital - which some would say add to the traffic problem even more, the 200 odd tongas are a mere drop in the ocean.<br />
The alternative being provided to the tongawallahs is a tehbazaari or a roadside shop. This shift in profession is something that most tongawallahs are not too keen about- they feel that the shops are located too far away from the Old Delhi area where they live. And neither do most of them have the capital to equip the shops with goods nor do they have the inclination to let go of their horses, which inevitably, they will have to, once their tongas are gone.<br />
Is there a solution to their plight? Majority of tongawallahs that I spoke to, are keen on an idea which, if it is implemented, can be a workable solution. It is simply, to let them refurbish their tongas as buggies(carriages) and allow them to cater to tourists in areas like India Gate, Red Fort etc. Indeed, many cities across the world are doing this already from the &#8216;Victorias&#8217; operating near the Gateway of India in Mumbai to the chariots rented out to tourists near the Colosseum in Rome to Fiacres, the quaint carriages that carry visitors around the old city of Vienna.<br />
Delhi can easily follow the examples of these cities and probably do a bit more, considering that it has a rich Mughal ancestry as well as a colonial past. Carriages can be furbished according to the areas where they ply. In the process, they can give tourists a chance to relive that era in style and thereby ensure that a slice of the past is still relevant in the present.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
Sixty years after independence, the caste question looms large in our consciousness. Far from being abolished, the caste system is at the centre of many debates of the day. Whether it is the larger question of the importance of caste in electoral politics, reservations, whether caste should be part of the census or not or the outrage over the Khap panchayat's actions, it is clear that caste is an arena of contention even today.<br />
There is a part of India which sees caste as an outdated institution that needs to be erased from all our calculations. It sees caste as a blight on modernity, a pathogen that infects us. Caste binds us to a collective rooted in the past and imposes on individuals a destiny that is not of their making. Caste hierarchy makes our future contingent on our birth, and those less fortunately born are condemned to a life more ordinary. What makes this more complex is the accelerated attempt to reverse history by the device of reservations which allocate opportunities purposively to the lower castes. This makes the distaste for caste even greater in the educated middle class, who see it as an instrument created for use specifically against them. The advantages that have accrued to this group have been internalised and neutralised and only the disadvantages loom threateningly, particularly 1 as the lower castes accumulate political power.<br />
It is interesting that the distaste for caste and its classification as a social evil has such wide currency. If the underlying purpose, that of ensuring that birth does not determine destiny, and that the individual must begin with a clean slate in building one's life, were indeed that important, then the idea of inheriting property should be seen as being equally unfair. After all, in today's world, nothing determines our life's trajectory as much as money. The fact that opponents of caste-based reservations are open to using economic criteria suggests that even they accept the unfairness of birth-determined wealth. Why is caste such an anachronism and inheritance such a modem idea?<br />
The idea is made to seem natural in the myth that markets create that everyone can aspire to becoming wealthy, and uses as its poster children, the lucky few who have built empires from scratch. We can admire them, but to argue that because some people are able to overcome constraints imposed on them by circumstances, no attempt should be made to level the playing field is not an argument that stands up to scrutiny. It would then seem that our distaste for the past is selective. The class that protests caste but . celebrates inheritance is the one that has nothing left to gain from caste and everything to lose if property rights are reformed. Of course, the larger market discourse makes this selective discrimination seem legitimate and modem.<br />

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
Early automobiles were sometimes only "horseless carriages' powered by gasoline or steam engines. Some of them were so noisy that cities often made laws forbidding their use because they frightened horses.<br />
Many countries helped to develop the automobile. The internal-combustion engine was invented in Austria and France was an early leader in automobile manufacturing. But it was in the United States after 1900 that the automobile was improved most rapidly. As a large and growing country, the United States needed cars and trucks to provide transportation in places not served by trains.<br />
Two brilliant ideas made possible the mass production of automobiles. An American inventor named Eli Whitney thought one of them, which is known as 'standardisation of parts'. In an effort to speed up production in his gun factory Whitney decided that each part of a gun could be made by machines so that it would be exactly like all the others of its kind.<br />
Another American, Henry Ford, developed the idea of the assembly line. Before Ford introduced the assembly line, each car was built by hand. Such a process was, of course, very slow. As a result, automobiles were so expensive that only rich people could afford them. Ford proposed a system in which each worker would have only a portion of the wheels. Another would place the wheels on the car. And still another would insert the bolts that held the wheels to the car. Each worker needed to learn only one or two routine tasks.<br />
But the really important part of Ford's idea was to bring the work to the worker. An automobile frame, which looks like a steel skeleton, was put on a moving platform. When the car reached the end of the line, it was completely assembled. Oil, gasoline and water were added and the car was ready to be driven away. With the increased production made possible by the assembly line, automobiles became much cheaper and more and more people were able to afford them. Today, it can be said that wheels run America. The four rubber tyres of the automobile move America through work and play.<br />
Even though the majority of Americans would find it hard to imagine what life could be without a car, some have begun to realise that the automobile is a mixed blessing. Traffic accidents are increasing steadily and large cities are plagued by traffic congestion. Worst of all, perhaps, is the air pollution caused by the internal combustion engine. Every car engine bums hundreds of gallons of fuel each year and pumps hundreds pounds of carbon monoxide and other gases into the air. These gases are one source of the smog that hangs over large cities. Some of these gases are poisonous and dangerous to health, especially for someone with a weak heart or a respiratory disease.<br />
One answer to the problem of air pollution is to build a car that does not pollute. That's what several major automobile manufacturers are trying to do. But building a clean car is easier said than done. So far progress has been slow. Another solution is to eliminate car fumes altogether by getting rid of the internal-combustion engine. Inventors are now working on turbine-powered cars, as well as on cars powered by steam and electricity. But most of us won't be driving cars run on batteries or boiling water for a while yet. Many auto-makers believe that it will take years to develop practical models that are powered by electricity or steam.<br />
To rid the world of pollution-pollution caused not just by cars, but by all of modem industrial life-many people believe we must make some fundamental changes in the way many of us live. Americans may, for example, have to cut down on the number of privately owned cars and depend more on public mass transit systems. Certainly the extensive use of new transit systems could cut down on traffic congestion and air pollution. But these changes sometimes clash head on with other urgent problems. For example, if a factory closes down because it cannot meet government pollution standards, a large number of workers suddenly find themselves without jobs. Questioning the quality of the air they breathe becomes less important than worrying about the next pay check. Drastic action must be taken if we are to reduce traffic accidents, traffic congestion and air pollution. While wheels have brought better and more convenient transportation, they have also brought new and unforeseen problems. Progress, it turns out, has more than one face.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
Other animals go about the world as nature made them. Why then, did man start to adorn himself by hanging things round his neck, arms, waist and legs or putting things on his head? We can imagine many reasons. If an exceptionally strong or brave man succeeded in killing an exceptionally large bear, might he not get the idea of boring a hole through one of its teeth with a sharp flint and tying the tooth round his neck in order to remind himself of his great achievement and to show his friends what a great man he was? Gradually it might become the custom in that tribe for all strong and brave hunters to wear a bear's tooth, and it might be regarded as a disgrace not to wear one and a sign that one was weak or very young.<br />
Another man might make an ornament of a coloured shell or stone simply because he liked it or because its shape reminded him of something. Then if he happened to escape from some danger when he was wearing it he might think the ornament had something to do with it that it had magic qualities. And his friends and relations would not be satisfied until they had an ornament of the same kind.<br />
People who wore ornaments would soon learn to arrange them in different ways according to their size and colour in order to make them more decorative and impressive. A necklace found in Italy with the skeleton of a young man of the Stone Age was quite elaborate. It consisted of stag's teeth arranged at intervals with, between them, two upper rows made up of the vertebrae of a fish and one row of shells.<br />
Another reason why men might tie feathers, horns, skins and all kinds of other things to themselves would be in order to make themselves look fierce and more terrifying to animals or to the men of other tribes.<br />
Objects that came from a distance and were therefore scarce-such as sea-shells to people living far inland-would come in time to have a special value, and might be worn only by chiefs and their families in order to show that they were particularly important people. Primitive tribes living today often associate themselves with some particular animal or bird, such as an angle or lion, or with a particular place, such as a mountain or river. Man may have started doing this kind of thing very early in his history. Then, every member of a group or family may have worn something such as feathers, claws or even a stone or wooden object of a certain shape or colour, to represent the animal or mountain or whatever it might be .that they believed themselves to be connected with.<br />
So, as we have seen, clothing may have started as ornament or to distinguish one tribe from another or to show rank or because certain things were believed to have magic qualities. But in some places a time came when men and women began to wear clothes for other reasons. During the Ice Ages, when the polar ice spread over far more of the world than it does today, some of the districts in which human beings were living became very cold and bleak indeed. Man must have learnt that he would be more comfortable and more likely to survive, if he covered his body with the skins of animals. At first perhaps, he would simply tie a skin round his waist or over his shoulders but as time passed he learnt how to treat skins in order to make them softer and more supple and how to join them together in order to make better garments.<br />
Flint tools have been found buried deep under the earth floors of caves in which prehistoric men sheltered when the weather became colder. Some of the tools were probably used to scrape the inner sides of skins to make them soft. Stone Age people may also have softened skins in the same way that Eskimo women do today, by chewing them. The teeth of Eskimo women are often worn down to stumps by the constant chewing of seal skins.<br />
Among the wonderful flint and bone tools and implements that later cave men made have been found some beautiful bone needles, some not much bigger than those we use today. Although the people who made them had only flint tools to work with, some of the needles are finer and more beautifully shaped than those of Roman times.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Years ago, when I was a young Assistant Professor at the Harvard Business School, I thought the role of business schools was to develop future managers who knew all about the various functions of business, to teach them how to define problems succinctly, analyse these problems and identify alternatives in a clear, logical fashion and finally, to teach them to make an intelligent decision.</li>
<li>My thinking gradually became tempered by living and working outside the United States and by serving seven years a$ a college president. During my presidency of Babson College, I added several additional traits or skills that I felt a good manager must possess.</li>
<li>One must have the ability to express oneself in a clear articulate fashion. Good oral and written communication skills are absolutely essential, if one is to be an effective manager. One must possess that intangible set of qualities called leadership skills. To be a good leader, one must understand and be sensitive to people and be able to inspire them towards the achievement of common goal. Effective managers must be broad-minded human beings who not only understand the world of business but also have a sense of the cultural, social, political, historical and (particularly today) the international aspects of life and society. This suggests that exposure to the liberal arts and humanities should be part of every manager's education.</li>
<li>A good manager in today's world must have courage and a strong sense of integrity. He or she must know where to draw the line between the right and the wrong.</li>
<li>That can be agonisingly difficult. Drawing a line in a corporate setting sometimes involves having to make a choice between what appears to be conflicting 'rights'. For example, if one is faced with a decision whether or not to close an ailing factory, whose interests should prevail? Those of stock-holders? Of employees? Of customers ? Or those of the community in which the factory is located? It is a tough choice. And the typical manager faces many others.</li>
<li>Sometimes these choices involve simple questions of honesty or truthfulness. More often they are more subtle and involve such issues as having to decide whether to 'cut comers' and economise to meet profit objectives that may be beneficial in the short run but that are<br />
not in the best long-term interests of the various groups being served by one's company. Making the right choice in situations such as these clearly demands integrity and the courage to follow where one's integrity leads.</li>
<li>But now I have left behind the cap and gown of a college president and put on the hat of chief executive officer. As a result of my experience as a corporate CEO, my list of desirable managerial traits has become still longer.</li>
<li>It now seems to me that what matters most in the majority of organisations is to have reasonably intelligent, hard working managers who have a sense of pride and loyalty towards their organisation; who can get to the root of a problem and are inclined towards action; who are decent human beings with a natural empathy and concern for people; who possess humour, humility and common-sense; and who are able to couple drive with resilience and patience in the accomplishment of a goal.</li>
<li>It is the ability to make positive things happen that most distinguishes the successful manager from the mediocre or unsuccessful one. It is far better to have dependable managers who can make the right things happen in a timely fashion than to have brilliant, sophisticated, highly educated executives who are excellent at planning and analysing, but who are not so good at implementing. The most cherished manager is the one who says "I can do it" and then does.</li>
<li>Many business schools continue to focus almost exclusively on the development of analytical skills. As a result, these schools are continuing to graduate large numbers of MBAs and business majors who know a great deal about analysing strategies, dissecting balance sheets and using computer-but who still don't know how to manage.</li>
<li>As a practical matter, or course, schools can go only so far in teaching their students to manage. Only hard knocks and actual work experience will fully develop the kind of managerial traits, skills and virtues that I have discussed here.</li>
<li>Put another way: the best way to learn to manage is to manage companies such as mine that hire aspiring young managers, that can help the process along by providing good role models and mentors, by setting clear standards and high expectations that emphasise the kind of broad leadership traits that are important to the organisation and by rewarding the young managers accordingly.</li>

<ol>
<li>In today's fiercely competitive business environment, companies need to communicate information pertaining to a whole range of issues in a lucid and precise manner to their customers.</li>
<li>This is particularly so in the case of companies which do business in areas such as manufacturing, information technology (IT), engineering products and services-companies whose products and services may not be understood by a customer not familiar with its technical aspects.</li>
<li>These communication materials are prepared in a company these days by 'technical writers'- people who can effectively communicate to an intended audience.</li>
<li>The skills of a technical writer are being increasingly sought for preparing marketing documents such as brochures, case studies, website content and media kits and for the preparation of a whole range of manuals. Though technical writers in a company do a good portion of such work, the trend now is to outsource technical writing to free-lancers.</li>
<li>Technical writing and writing text-books are poles apart. The former is aimed at those who do not have an in-depth knowledge about a product and hence should be direct and lucid. An overdose of technical terms and jargon would only add to the confusion of the customer.</li>
<li>The basic requirement for being a technical writer is near-total mastery over English language. A technical writer should be natural in creative writing and needs to be an expert in using Business English.</li>
<li>This simply means that those with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature alongwith a diploma/degree in Journalism and having a Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Applications (PGDCA) are ideal candidates for being employed as technical writers.</li>
<li>According to Joe Winston, Chief Executive Officer of 'I-manger', speaking ability is not imperative for a technical writer. All that one needs is the talent to write in a simple and effective manner. Many have inhibitions in speaking English but their writing skills would be very sharp.</li>
<li>Technical writing would be a good option for such people. If a candidate is to be assigned the task of preparing high-end technical manuals, he/she is required to have higher qualifications such as an M.A./M.Phil. in English Literature and a degree such as M.C.A.</li>
<li>Companies look for such qualifications because technical writers first need to understand the technical information themselves, before trying to communicate it in de-jargonised language to the potential customers.</li>
<li>However, it is also time that many companies provide rigorous on-the-job training to fresh technical writers before allowing them to graduate to high-end products.</li>
<li>Though the demand for good technical writers has risen sharply over the years, the emphasis is never on numbers but on skills.</li>
<li>They point out that even graduates of English literature are often found wanting when it comes to creative and effective writing.</li>
<li>Merely having the right mix of writing and comprehension skills is not sufficient. A technical writer should keep his 'writing blades' constantly sharpened. It means untold hours of reading up the latest in the technological trends and ceaseless honing of one's Business English and writing skills. The nature of technical writing is such that a writer has to be at the peak of his expressive powers in each piece of writing he produces.</li>
<li>A career in technical writing is seen as a good choice for women mainly because it is widely held that women Eire more adept at creative writing than men and the job does not entail 'graveyard shifts' or 'arduous travelling'.</li>
<li>A beginner can expect to be paid anywhere between ? 8,000 to ? 15,000 a month. Technical writers usually join as executive technical writers and then go on to become senior technical writers, team leaders, documentation heads and some even manage to make it to a management job within a decade. As in most private sector jobs, merit is the main criterion for rise in job and not necessarily the number of years one has put in.</li>

Why did the world's most famous, and priciest, makers of writing instruments launch a lakhpati pen in the name of a man famous for wearing nothing more than a handspun loincloth? They did not honour Mahatma Gandhi because research turned up fascinating data suggesting that the world's millionaires had overnight converted into apostles of non-violence and abandoned their T-bone steaks for goat's milk. The reason was that its marketing department identified India as their best growing market.<br />
Modest ink pens used to be a staple of Indian stores, with stained-finger schoolchildren as customers. The triumph of the ball pen has reduced that to a quaint memory. Having lost its base, the pen showed astonishing powers of reinvention; it became upwardly mobile without doing much more than it did in its populist avatar. Within the last decade, high-end pen shops have moved from an occasional presence in Delhi's five-star boutiques to high-rent markets where the elite come to spend a thousand rupees for a hundred grams of cheese. If the price of these pens makes you stagger, just remember that cheesy millionaires do not stagger easily.<br />
Why have branded pens become such a hit with the Indian rich? Is it because the rich have shifted their primary loyalty from the goddess Lakshmi to the goddess Saraswati? Have they become so literary that, after a day rewriting balance sheets, they spend their evenings stringing pearls of wisdom in variable verse? Alas, not true. The wheeler has not turned into a dealer in poetic phrases.<br />
The demand for pricey pens has multiplied because it has risen from the tarmac of legitimate need, lifted towards pocket-showoffs, and now rocketed into the stratosphere of ruling class affectation. It has become a most desirable gift for those in power because it comes attached with respectability. This is not considered a bribe, mind you. The most expensive pen in history would be inadequate as substitute for cash for a minister on closure of a deal. The pen, particularly one with contorted shapes on its head, is just right as a gesture towards the new royalty in return for an audience, even if the new royals use it only to scribble their initials. It is the kind of male jewellery that helps to keep a file moving. The movement may or may not be in the right direction, but why risk immobility in mid-journey?<br />
As happens so often, the pen-marketing chaps got the facts right and conclusions wrong. Identifying India as the market was totally correct; making Gandhi the icon was silly. The Indian who buys .boutique pens dismisses Gandhi as a sermonising bore with crackpot theories, the sort of hero safer dead than around, useful for street names but not for the boardroom or indeed the Cabinet. A pencil might be more appropriately named after Gandhi, preferably one sold in stub sizes.</p>

qproRead the following passages carefully:<br/>
While you were glued to your flat screen, with your eyeballs popping out every time the ball was hit for a six, in a dark comer of India-in a Haryana village very close to the national capital-a dog was barking. Since it was a Dalit dog (in India, even dogs have caste), the upper caste Jaats were getting all riled up. So, they decided to teach the dog a lesson. A bunch of them surrounded a Dalit house and set it on fire. Inside the house were trapped an 18-year-old girl and her old father. Since the girl was physically challenged and could not move out of the burning house, she and her father were engulfed and consumed by the fire. This is how people teach a lesson to dogs in New India: by making the poor, lower castes die like dogs.<br />
New India is nothing but a banana republic. Here the reality looks like a mythical drama and a fake drama called IPL looks like real. So, when a Dalit girl is burnt to death by a gang of upper caste loonies, nothing happens, not a soul is stirred, no one comes out on streets to protest. But when Dhoni lifts a ball into the stands, thousands of people go berserk as if this is the only reality that matters, as if this is the only reality that will make India stand on its feet. No one knows, how many bets are won or lost on each IPL six, how much money rides on every wide ball.<br />
Free market is not a free licence to loot, Barack Obama reminded the Wall Street honchos this week. Every dollar carries hopes and aspirations of millions of people, the US President said. Obama will look like a silly fool in India, where free market has become a synonym for crony capitalism of the worst kind. In fact, it is turning into predatory capitalism where the rich and powerful hunt the poor and weak without any fear, with the full backing of the state.<br />
The dalit girl's death is only one of the millions of stories of injustice and cruelty unfolding in front of us. We can't see them because we are busy watching IPL. Or, maybe, we are watching IPL because the reality is too much to bear.<br />
At 800 million, India is the world's poorest nation. It's the poorest nation ever in human history. The number of people trapped in poverty and bondage in this country is double the population of Africa. It's more than the combined population of North and South Americas. But who cares. New India needs its daily fix of IPL.<br />
